/** A Migration service.
 * There is currently only one concrete implementation of this interface and no
 * general way to add new MigrationServices yet. This class is not finished.
 *
 * The goal of migration is usually to replace old properties or data files
 * with new one. The fact is that according to the data that will be updated
 * the migration may need to be done at various places during jEdit's startup
 * This prevent from calling all migration services at a specific time during
 * startup.
 * However the service exists so it doesn't add a compilation dependency
 * to jEdit.java class
