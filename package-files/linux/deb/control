Description: A real editor for programmers
 As one of the most feature rich editors available, jEdit boasts
 support for syntax highlighting in more than 140 languages. jEdit
 is more  than just an editor, and its functionality is extended by
 the use of 'plugins' which include tools for ant and console
 integration as well as a host of other features. Any serious
 programmer will undoubtedly want to give jEdit a good look.
