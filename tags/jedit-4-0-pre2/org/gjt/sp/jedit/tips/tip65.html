<html><body>The <b>ignore case</b> search and replace flag behaves
intelligently when replacing occurrences of the search string.
If the occurrence is all lower case, all upper case or title case,
the replace string will be converted into the relevant case when
inserted into the buffer.<p>

This automatic conversion is only performed if the replacement
string is all-lower case.</body></html>
