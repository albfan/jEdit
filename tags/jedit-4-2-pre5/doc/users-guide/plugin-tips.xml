<para>
  Recall that any class whose name ends with <classname>Plugin.class</classname>
  is called a plugin core class.
  JAR files with no plugin core classes are also loaded by jEdit; 
  the classes they contain are
  made available to other plugins.  Many plugins that rely on
  third-party class libraries ship them as separate JAR files.  The libraries
  will be available inside the jEdit environment but are not part of a general
  classpath or library collection when running other Java applications.
</para>

<para>
  A plugin that bundles extra JAR files must list them in the
  <filename>plugin.<replaceable>class name</replaceable>.jars</filename>
  property. See the documentation for the
  <ulink url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/EditPlugin.html">
  <classname>EditPlugin</classname></ulink> class for details.
