The default behavior of the <b>C+LEFT</b> and <b>C+RIGHT</b> commands is to
stop both at the beginning and the end of each word. However this can be
changed in the <b>Text Area</b> pane of the <b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Global
Options</b> dialog box to match the behavior of many other programs, where
these commands move over a word in addition to any whitespace at the end.
