//{{{ OneTimeMigrationService class
/** Base class from which one can more easily implement a migration step
    that should be executed only once per installation.
    <p>
    Concrete implementations of this class should register themselves in services.xml.
    jEdit will call doMigration() on each object, which will skip the ones that
    have been done before.
    <p>
    The time that these services are automatically executed by jEdit is during the
    "initializing properties" step. This means that implementations that need to
    update or remove certain properties during upgrades can take advantage of this class.
    <p> NOTE: This happens after plugins are started, which might be too late for some
    plugins, such as the XMLPlugin, so using the services API to start them is not always
    desireable.
    <p>
    Example:
    <pre>
    &lt;SERVICE CLASS=&quot;org.jedit.migration.OneTimeMigrationService&quot; NAME=&quot;checkFileStatus&quot; &gt;
	  new org.jedit.migration.CheckFileStatus();
	&lt;/SERVICE&gt;
	</pre>
