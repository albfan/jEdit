<p> Lightweight Scripting for Java. <a href="http://www.beanshell.org/">www.beanshell.org</a> </p>
<p>
This project has been dead since 2005, probably because JavaScript has been added to 
the JDK providing an alternate scripting language that is already built-in.
Even though it is used in many parts of jEdit's code, we do not plan to maintain it
or make any major changes to it beyond what has already been done. </p>
