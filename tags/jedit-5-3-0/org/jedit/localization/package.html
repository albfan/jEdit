<p>This folder contains property files for localization in different
languages. To add another localization to jEdit, you can add
a new property file to this folder, but be sure to also fix
the following properties in <tt>jedit_gui.props</tt>. </p>
<ol>
<li> Update the
<tt>available.lang</tt> to list
the 2-letter localization code for the language you added.
</li>
<li> Add a new property for the "display name"
of the new language, preferably in the language itself. For example:
<pre>
options.appearance.lang.ja=日本語
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
