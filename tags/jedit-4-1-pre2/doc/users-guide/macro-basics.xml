<chapter id="macro-basics"><title>Introducing BeanShell</title>

  <para>
   Here is how BeanShell's author, Pat Niemeyer, describes his creation:
  </para>

  <blockquote>
   <para>
    <quote>BeanShell is a small, free, embeddable, Java source
    interpreter with object scripting language features, written in
    Java. BeanShell executes standard Java statements and
    expressions, in addition to obvious scripting commands and
    syntax. BeanShell supports scripted objects as simple method
    closures like those in Perl and JavaScript.</quote>
   </para>
  </blockquote>

  <para>
   You do not have to know anything about Java to begin writing your own
   jEdit macros. But if you know how to program in Java, you already know
   how to write BeanShell scripts.  The major strength of using
   BeanShell with a program written in Java is that it allows the user to
   customize the program's behavior using the same interfaces
   designed and used by the program itself. BeanShell can
   turn a well-designed application into a powerful, extensible toolkit.
  </para>

  <para>
   This guide focuses on using BeanShell in macros. If you are interested
   in learning more about BeanShell generally, consult the <ulink
   url="http://www.beanshell.org">BeanShell web site</ulink>. Information
   on how to run and organize macros, whether included with the jEdit
   installation or written by you, can be found in
   <xref linkend="using-macros"/>.
