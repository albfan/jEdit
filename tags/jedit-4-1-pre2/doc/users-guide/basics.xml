 <sect1 id="buffers"><title>Buffers</title>
  <para>
   Several files can be opened and edited at once.
   Each open file is referred to as a <firstterm>buffer</firstterm>.
   The combo box above the text area selects the buffer to edit.
   Different emblems are displayed next to buffer names in the list,
   depending the buffer's state;
   a red disk is shown for buffers with unsaved changes,
   a lock is shown for read-only buffers,
   and a spark is shown for new buffers which don't yet exist on disk.
  </para>
  <para>
   In addition to the buffer combo box, various commands can also be
   used to select the buffer to edit.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to Previous Buffer</guimenuitem>
   (keyboard shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>Page Up</keycap>
   </keycombo>) switches to the previous buffer in the list.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to Next Buffer</guimenuitem>
   (keyboard shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>Page Down</keycap>
   </keycombo>) switches to the next buffer in the list.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to Recent Buffer</guimenuitem>
   (keyboard shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>`</keycap></keycombo>)
   switches to the buffer that was being edited prior to the current one.
  </para>
  <sect2><title>Memory Usage</title>
   <para>
    The maximum number of open buffers depends on available <firstterm>Java
    heap memory</firstterm>. When stored in the Java heap, each buffer requires
    approximately two and a half times it's size on disk. This overhead is caused
    by the file being stored internally as Unicode (see
    <xref linkend="encodings" />), and the fact that additional information,
    such as line numbers, also needs to be stored.
   </para>
   <para>
    The status bar at the bottom of the view displays used and total Java
    heap memory; see <xref linkend="status-bar" /> for details. This can give
    you a rough idea of how much memory the currently opened files are using.
    The Java heap grows if it runs out of room; but it only grows to a certain
    maximum size, and attempts to allocate Java objects that would grow the
    heap beyond this size fail with out-of-memory errors.
   </para>
   <para>
    One side-effect of this is that if the maximum heap size is set too low,
    opening large files or performing other memory-intensive operations can
    fail, even if you have a lot of system memory free. The solution is to
    change the Java heap size.
   </para>
   <para>
    To change the heap size on Windows, run <quote>Set jEdit Parameters</quote>
    from the <quote>jEdit</quote> group in the
    Programs menu. Then, in the resulting dialog box, under <quote>Command
    line options for Java executable</quote>, change the option that looks like
    so:
   </para>
   <screen>-mx32m</screen>
   <para>
    (See <xref linkend="launcher-starting"/> for more information about the
    <quote>Set jEdit Parameters</quote> dialog box.)
   </para>
   <para>
    On Unix, edit the <filename>jedit</filename> shell script and change the
    line that looks like so:
   </para>
   <screen>JAVA_HEAP_SIZE=32</screen>
   <para>
    In both cases, replace <quote>32</quote> with the desired heap size, in
    megabytes.
   </para>
  </sect2>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="views"><title>Views</title>
  <para>
   Each editor window is known as a <firstterm>view</firstterm>.
   It is possible to have multiple views open at once, and each view can
   be split into multiple panes.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>New View</guimenuitem> creates a new view.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Close View</guimenuitem> closes the
   current view. If only one view is open, closing it will exit jEdit,
   unless background mode is on; see <xref linkend="starting" /> for information
   about starting jEdit in background mode.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Split
   Horizontally</guimenuitem>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>2</keycap></keycombo>)
   splits the view into two text areas, placed above each other.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Split
   Vertically</guimenuitem>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>3</keycap></keycombo>)
   splits the view into two text areas, placed next to each other.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Unsplit</guimenuitem>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>1</keycap></keycombo>)
   removes all but the current text area from the view.
  </para>
  <para>
   When a view is split, editing commands operate on the text area that
   has keyboard focus. To give a text area keyboard focus, click in it
   with the mouse, or use the following commands.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to
   Previous Text Area</guimenuitem>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>Page Up</keycap></keycombo>)
   shifts keyboard focus to the previous text area.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to
   Next Text Area</guimenuitem>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>Page Down</keycap></keycombo>)
   shifts keyboard focus to the next text area.
  </para>
  <para>
   Clicking the text area with the right mouse button displays a popup menu.
   Both this menu and the tool bar at the top of the view offer quick
   mouse-based access to frequently-used commands.
   The contents of the tool bar and right-click menu can be
   changed in the <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global
   Options</guimenuitem> dialog box.
  </para>
  <sect2 id="docking"><title>Window Docking</title>
   <para>
    The file system browser, HyperSearch results window, and many plugin
    windows can optionally be docked into the view. This can be
    configured in the <guibutton>Docking</guibutton> pane of the
    <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</guimenuitem>
    dialog box; see <xref linkend="global-opts" />.
   </para>
   <para>
    When windows are docked into the view, strips of buttons are shown in the
    left, right, top, and bottom sides of the text area. Each strip contains
    buttons for the windows docked in that location, as well as a close box.
    Clicking a window's button shows that dockable window; clicking the close
    box hides the window again.
   </para>
   <para>
    The commands in the <guimenu>View</guimenu>&gt;<guisubmenu>Docking</guisubmenu>
    menu (shortcuts: <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>E</keycap></keycombo>
    <keycap>1</keycap>, <keycap>2</keycap>, <keycap>3</keycap>, <keycap>4</keycap>)
    provide keyboard equivalents for the close boxes.
   </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 id="status-bar"><title>The Status Bar</title>
   <para>
    The <firstterm>status bar</firstterm> at the bottom of the view consists
    of the following components, from left to right:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>The line number containing the caret</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>The column position of the caret, with the leftmost column
    being 1.</para>
    <para>
     If the line contains tabs, the <firstterm>file</firstterm> position (where a hard
     tab is counted as one column) is shown first, followed by the
     <firstterm>screen</firstterm> position (where each tab counts for the number of
     columns until the next tab stop).
    </para>
    <para>
     Double-clicking on the caret location indicator displays the
     <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to Line</guimenuitem> dialog
     box; see <xref linkend="lines" />.

 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="textarea"><title>The Text Area</title>
  <para>
   Text editing takes place in the text area. It behaves in a similar
   manner to many Windows and MacOS editors; the few
   unique features will be described in this section.
  </para>
  <para>
   The text area will automatically scroll up or down if text editing is performed
   closer than three lines from the top or bottom of the text area. This
   feature is called <firstterm>electric scrolling</firstterm> and can be disabled
   in the <guibutton>Text Area</guibutton> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</guimenuitem>
   dialog box; see <xref linkend="global-opts" />.
  </para>
  <para>
   To aid in locating the caret, the current line is drawn with a
   different background color. To make it clear which lines end with
   white space, end of line markers are drawn at the end of each line.
   Both these features can be disabled in the <guibutton>Text Area</guibutton>
   pane of the <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global
   Options</guimenuitem> dialog box.
  </para>
  <para>
   The strip on the left of the text area is called a <firstterm>gutter</firstterm>.
   The gutter displays marker and register locations; it will also display
   line numbers if the 
   <guimenu>View</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Line Numbers</guimenuitem> (shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>E</keycap></keycombo>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>T</keycap></keycombo>) command is invoked.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="repeat"><title>Command Repetition</title>
  <para>
   There is one other jEdit feature that needs to be discussed before we
   continue further.
   To repeat a command any number of times, invoke
   <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Repeat Next Command</guimenuitem>
   (shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>Enter</keycap></keycombo>) and enter the
   desired repeat count, followed by the command to repeat (either a keystroke
   or menu item selection). For example,
   <quote><keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>Enter</keycap></keycombo>
   <keycap>1</keycap> <keycap>4</keycap>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>D</keycap></keycombo></quote> will delete
   14 lines, and <quote><keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>Enter</keycap></keycombo>
   <keycap>8</keycap>
   <keycap>#</keycap></quote>
   will insert <quote>########</quote> in the buffer.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you specify a repeat count greater than 20, a confirmation dialog box will
   be displayed, asking if you really want to perform the action. This prevents
   you from hanging jEdit by executing a command too many times.
  </para>
