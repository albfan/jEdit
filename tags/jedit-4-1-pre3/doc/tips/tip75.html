<p>Dragging in the text area with the middle mouse button
creates a selection without moving the
caret. As soon as the mouse button is released, the selected text is
inserted at the caret position and the selection is deactivated.</p>

<p>This feature has two additional, more suttle behaviors:</p>

<ul>
<li>If there already is a selection when you start middle-dragging, the selection
will be replaced with the region you marked with the mouse.</li>
<li>Holding down <b>Control</b> while dragging the middle mouse button marks a
rectangular area, and pastes it vertically at the caret location (or into the
current selection).</li>
</ul>
