<html><body>When loading a file, jEdit remembers if it had a trailing
line separator character. While this line separator is never shown in the text
area, it is written back to the file when the buffer is saved.<p>

The trailing line separator can be removed in the
<b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Buffer Options</b> dialog box.</body></html>
