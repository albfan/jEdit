{{{ API Changes

- Fixed jedit exit procedure. Now all views are closed. Earlier only

  ViewUpdate.CLOSED messages. (Jarek Czekalski)

- The JEditEmbeddedTextArea do not create an empty popup menu anymore.
  To add a context menu in your JEditEmbeddedTextArea, please override
  createPopupMenu(MouseEvent evt) as before, but also call
  setRightClickPopupEnabled(true) in your constructor (Matthieu Casanova)

  (Matthieu Casanova)

  text in a buffer. (Matthieu Casanova)

  CopyFileWorker(Component comp, VFSFile[] vfsFiles, String target)
  CopyFileWorker(Component comp, VFSFile[] vfsFiles, String target,
  			Behavior behavior)
  CopyFileWorker(Component comp, File[] files, String target)
  CopyFileWorker(Component comp, File[] files, String target, Behavior behavior)

  copy(ProgressObserver progress, VFS sourceVFS, Object sourceSession,
  	String sourcePath, VFS targetVFS, Object targetSession,
  	String targetPath, Component comp, boolean canStop,
  	boolean sendVFSUpdate)
  copy(ProgressObserver progress, String sourcePath,String targetPath,
  	Component comp, boolean canStop, boolean sendVFSUpdate)

  instead (Matthieu Casanova)

  Chunk became private as they should be in the first place.
    Specifically:
      org.gjt.sp.jedit.syntax.DisplayTokenHandler

        initChunk()  (* this was protected)
      org.gjt.sp.jedit.syntax.Chunk
        accessable
        initialized
        style
        width
        Chunk constructors
