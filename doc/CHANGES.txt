JEDIT 4.2pre1 VERSION HISTORY

* Version 4.2pre1

Thanks to Kris Kopicki for contributing to this release.

+ Enhancements:

- If regular expressions are enabled, Search->Find Previous now shows a
  dialog box message instead of silently searching forwards.

- Improved C pre-processor syntax highlighting.

- Quick copy now more consistent with usual mouse behavior:

  - Control-middle-clicking on a bracket will insert the contents of the
    bracketed block at the caret position.

  - Shift-middle-clicking at a point will insert text from the caret to
    the point at the caret position. Can be used to duplicate a line,
    for example.

+ Optimizations:

- Faster buffer loading.

- Faster activity log.

+ Platform-Specific Changes:

- MacOS plugin version 3.0 now requires Java 1.4.1. All native calls now
  use the Cocoa API, and a dock menu has been added. The dock menu
  provides similar functionality to the plugin menu (Kris Kopicki).

+ Bug Fixes:

- jEdit no longer minimizes and then restores windows when files are
  opened through the edit server on windows. This was done to work
  around an apparent bug in the Windows JRE. If you still experience the
  problem, execute this BeanShell code:

  jEdit.setBooleanProperty("server.brokenToFront",true);

- Some HTTP proxies decompress GZip streams for whatever reason. The
  plugin manager now checks if the stream starts with the GZip magic
  characters; if not, it parses it without decompression, instead of
  throwing an exception.

- Multiple monitors should work properly now (Kris Kopicki).
