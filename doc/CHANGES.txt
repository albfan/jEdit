  			Behavior behavior)
  CopyFileWorker(Component comp, File[] files, String target)

  copy(ProgressObserver progress, VFS sourceVFS, Object sourceSession,
  	String sourcePath, VFS targetVFS, Object targetSession,
  	String targetPath, Component comp, boolean canStop,
  	boolean sendVFSUpdate)

  	Component comp, boolean canStop, boolean sendVFSUpdate)
  (Matthieu Casanova)

- New methods MiscUtilities.getCompleteBaseName() to return 
  the (complete) base names of a file (until the last .) and

  which is now deprecated (Matthieu Casanova, Alan Ezust)

- OperatingSystem.isOS2() method is removed since OS/2 cannot run jEdit since
  many years (Matthieu Casanova)

  anymore Windows is the only DOS derived OS, so use OperatingSystem.isWindows()
  instead (Matthieu Casanova)

{{{ Miscellaneous

- Pasting a VFSFile as String dataflavor will now paste the full path instead of
  the name of the file (Matthieu Casanova)

- The EditingOptionPane has now an option to remember the user choice about
  large file treatment (Matthieu Casanova)

- Removed 192mb heap size limit from startup scripts.
  Removed jedit.l4j.ini from Windows package files because no options were left.
  NOTE:
    Old jedit.l4j.ini won't be removed on upgrade. In that case, manual
    removal will be required. Please look for jedit.l4j.ini in the
    install directory after running the installer. If you found only
    "-Xmx192M" in the file, you can remove it or the file itself.

- OS/2 tasks were removed from the Java installer as OS/2 does not
  have a working Java 6 implementation and probably never will have
  (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- jEdit support for keymaps (Matthieu Casanova)

- User Settings directory migrated to %APPDATA%/jEdit on Windows
  (#2510763 - Alan Ezust)

- Added support for "Find Previous" when searching in multiple files (Evan Wright)
