- The Java based installer now correctly handles GNU style long filenames in
  the installer package and thus does not corrupt the JavaDoc files anymore
  (Bug #2327520 - Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- Several message boxes were not being created on the EDT which would result in
  tiny, non-resizable message boxes. (Bug #3441535, Dale Anson)

- Once an auxiliary font is used as font substitution for a character,
  that font could be wrongly used for following characters even if they
  could be displayed with the main font. (the problem was reported by

- Made basic edit operations aware of characters above BMP and combining
  character sequences.
