      <question id="wont-start"><para>
        jEdit won't start. What should I do?
      </para></question>
      <answer><para>
        If you don't have a clue as to why you cannot run jEdit, it's
        best to perform a step-by-step diagnosis.  Begin by finding the
        Java application loader you are using: <filename>java.exe</filename>,
        <filename>javaw.exe</filename> or <filename>java</filename>. Make sure
        it is running by entering its full path with the <userinput>-h</userinput>
        parameter in a terminal or console window.  If you can't find
        the Java application loader, your Java runtime environment package
        may be missing or incomplete.
      </para>
      <para>
          Next, find where you have installed jEdit.  You should look
          for the file <filename>jedit.jar</filename> which contains all
          of the application's Java class files in a compressed archive.
      </para>
      <para>
          Once you have both files, run the Java loader with the
          <userinput>-jar</userinput> option and with
          <filename>jedit.jar</filename> as the target.  Make sure that
          you either specify full paths for both files or that the
          directories for the files are part of your <filename>PATH</filename>
          environment variable. If jEdit does not load at this point, the likely
          problem is a corrupt <filename>jedit.jar</filename> file. Try
          downloading the application again.
      </para>
      <para>
          If jEdit does load using this procedure, you need to examine
          the <quote>shortcut</quote> loading mechanism you wish to use.
      </para>
      <para>
        On Linux and MacOS X, you need to find and examine the <filename>jedit</filename>
        shell script provided by the installation routine to confirm that the
        script's commands target the correct files and locations, and that
        variables like <filename>JAVA_HOME</filename> are either defined in the
        script or elsewhere in your shell's environment. Don't forget to make
        sure that the script's file permissions allow you to execute it as a shell script.
      </para>
      <para>
          On Windows, if you are using a batch script to run jEdit, the
          same points (other than file permissions) apply to examining
          <filename>jedit.bat</filename>.  If you are using
          jEditLauncher, run <userinput>jedit /p</userinput> in jEdit's
          installation directory from a command line to get the custom
          loader's setup dialog.  Here you can check the paths for both
          the Java application loader and jEdit as well as any command
          line parameters for both programs.  Make sure that you have
          placed Java and jEdit options in the correct input fields.
          If the parameters seems correct
          but jEdit will not load with the Windows launcher, try
          uninstalling and reinstalling the launcher by running
          <userinput>jedit /u</userinput> followed by
          <userinput>jedit /i</userinput>.
      </para>
      <para>
          If at this point you're still stuck, ask for help on the
          jedit-users mailing list, the jEdit Community
          <quote>Installation</quote> message board or on IRC.
          You're bound to find someone quickly.

      <question id="start-missing-plugins"><para>
        After jEdit starts, I can't see all of the plugins I have downloaded.
        How can I make them appear?
      </para></question>
      <answer><para>
        If you use jEdit's Plugin Manager to download and install plugins, your
        plugins will be found in the <filename>jars</filename> subdirectory of
        one of two directories: either the directory in which jEdit is
        installed, or the current user's settings directory. These are the only
        location jEdit examines when it loads plugins at startup.
      </para>
      <para>
        The default location of the settings directory depends on your operating
        system. You can find out its location during a jEdit session by
        evaluating <userinput>jedit.getSettingsDirectory()</userinput> in BeanShell.
      </para>
      <para>
          The settings directory can be changed by using the
          <userinput>-settings</userinput> command line parameter. If you change the
          location of the settings directory with this parameter, jEdit will not
          be able to find plugin archive files in the old location.
          If you use or change the <userinput>-settings</userinput>
          parameter, make sure your plugins don't get left behind.
      </para>
      </answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
      <question id="problems-out-of-memory"><para>
        During an editing session I get an error message about an
        <quote>OutOfMemoryError</quote> while working with a large file or
        performing a lengthy operation. The message reappears every time
        I retry the operation.  How can I prevent this?
      </para></question>
      <answer><para>
        One solution that often works is to set or increase the allocation of
        memory to the heap for Java objects created by the Java Virtual Machine
        in which jEdit is running. Add the command line option
        <userinput>-mxXXm</userinput> to the options passed to the version of
        the Java application loader you are using (such as
        <filename>java</filename>, <filename>java.exe</filename> or
        <filename>javaw.exe</filename>). In place of the
        <userinput>XX</userinput> in the option, use a multiple of 16
        between 32 and 128. If you already are using the option, increase the
        numeric portion of the <userinput>-mxXXm</userinput> parameter in
        increments of 16. Many users have good results using 48 or 64, but you
        should try different values for the best result on your installation.
       </para>
       <para>
        If you are using the <userinput>-jar</userinput> command line option
        with Java to run jEdit, remember that the <userinput>-jar</userinput>
        parameter must be the last Java option, followed immediately by the path
        to <filename>jedit.jar</filename> and then any jEdit command line options.
       </para>
       <para>
        If out of memory errors occur while running a build or compilation
        operation from within jEdit, you can also have the operation run in an
        external process rather than inside the same Java Virtual Machine
        running jEdit. The AntFarm plugin, for example, lets you select this
        approach as a configuration option. In other cases, you can run an
        external program using the command line interface of the Console plugin,
        which will capture and display the output of the external process and in
        many cases parse the output for error information.

		<question id="general-borders">
			<para>
			    Why is jEdit's window movement and resizing so buggy?
			</para>
		</question>
		<answer>
			<para>
			    Perhaps the option to let Java draw window borders is
				enabled. This option can lead to strange behavior on some Java versions and operating systems. Disable it in the <guilabel>Appearance</guilabel> tab of the <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</guimenuitem> dialog box.

      <question id="install-no-such-file"><para>
        What should I do when the installer displays the message,
        <screen>No such file or directory</screen>?
      </para></question>
      <answer><para>
        The full message that you may receive from the Java application launcher
        begins as follows:
        <screen>Exception in thread "main" java.util.zip.ZipException: No such file or directory
...</screen>
        This means that the Java application launcher cannot read the
        jar archive file that you specified on the command line. If your Java
        runtime environment otherwise runs properly, then either you have named
        the incorrect file name or the installation file is corrupt or
        incomplete. Check the file name, download the installer again if
        necessary, and be sure to follow any specific instructions for your
        operating system posted on the <ulink
        url="http://www.jedit.org">jEdit web site</ulink>.
      </para></answer>

		<question id="install-noclassdef">
			<para>
				After downloading <filename>jeditXXXinstall.jar</filename> (the
				<filename>XXX</filename> represents the version number), I tried to run
				<userinput>java jeditXXXinstall.jar</userinput>, but got the error message,
				<screen>Exception in main(), NoClassDefFoundError: jeditXXXinstall/jar.</screen> What am I doing wrong?
			</para>
		</question>
		<answer>
	
			<para>
				You need to specify the <userinput>-jar</userinput> option for the Java
				application loader so that the loader will search the installation archive
				for the starting class file. Without the option, it treats the archive as a
				single class file (which it is not!), thus producing the error. The correct
				command line would be <userinput>java -jar jeditXXXinstall.jar</userinput>.

        <question id="jedit-crashed">
                <para>
                        jEdit crashed the JVM, what gives?
                </para>
        </question>
		<answer>
			<para>
				It's important to realise that java applications should never do this.
				The problem is almost certainly a bug in the JVM. Problems of this
				nature are often tricky to solve. Depending on your platform, there
				should be information logged about what caused the crash to occur. For
				Unix type systems you will likely get an error in the console (and for
				Mac OS X you may also get a report in ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/JavaApplicationStub.crash.log).
				Some recent problems with Java 1.4.x and Windows were the result of a
				bug in the JVM and certain graphics card drivers.

        <question id="general-slow">
			<para>
				Why is jEdit so slow?
			</para>
        </question>
		<answer>
			<para>
				There may be many causes for this. Java by nature is more demanding on hardware than native
				applications. Modern computers should not have much problem with this.
			</para>
			<para>
				The most likely cause is plugins that parse buffers or do other computationally expensive
				operations. These include XML, SpeedJava and CodeAid. If performance is important to you, installing
				a whole batch of plugins in one go is probably not a very good idea. Install them one at a time,
				so you can evaluate the effects of each.
				
				<note>
					<para>
					If you are experiencing slow downs when switching and saving buffers (up to 20 second delays) and you
					have the TaskList plugin installed, check that the version is greater than 0.4. Versions after 0.4 fix
					the problem.
