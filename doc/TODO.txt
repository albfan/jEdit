TO DO

- C+d with selection: delete all selected lines
- position bug still there
- either fix recent files/recent directories/current dir icon issue, or
  ditch icons
- changing folding mode using buffer-local props: doesn't take effect on
  save (?) -- removing doesn't work, but setting to none works
- read up on JDK 1.4 focus API
- getFoldLevel(): should not call linesChanged() all the time
- v2p/p2v: implement from end backward scan
- {: only re-indent line if prev matches the regexp
- isToolsJarAvailable(): prompt for location in a file dialog box. Need
  some way of showing arbitriary message in VFS file chooser.
- dwm: not always focused correctly
- documentation to do
  - new folding
  - add index terms throughout user's guide!
  - changing heap memory docs
  - tip about compareStrings()
  - trailing EOL
  - 'evaluate for selected lines'
  - smart case insens replace
  - write explicit folding tips
  - API guide: compareStrings(), showPopupMenu()
  - MiscUtilities path name methods need to be documented
- still fold at end expand bug -- last line always visible?
- investigate nextLineRequested() -- replace with a buffer event.
- investigate wrap around in macros
- still collapseFolds behavior problems
- loading and saving opt pane: 'choose' button for backup directory
- style setting for folding line indicator
- search in directory: should not be so slow
- inefficencies: lots of File objects created for the sake of
  isAbsolute().
- check: pressing Enter on an open file
- stylesheet: keycap inside keycombo
- -noplugins command line switch
- I/O errors and plugin load errors batched together in one dialog box
- plugin error dialogs have 'Update Plugins' button
- icons in i/o error, plugin error dialog boxes
- if moving caret resulted in expansion of a fold, that fold should be
  collapsed when the caret leaves that fold
- next-fold/prev-fold actions
- plugin manager: show all dependencies, not just first-order ones
- removing a plugin should offer to remove the ones that depend on it too
- idea: position caret after [nnn lines] to insert stuff after a
  collapsed fold? anything other than newline: insert before [nnn lines].
  a newline: insert after last line of fold.
- help viewer: two tabs, contents and index. index browser
- improved window docking:
  - do something about there being more buttons than can fit
  - DockableLayout: handle too large
  - double click on dockable panel to hide
  - CCW rotated text not drawn correctly
- file system browser:
  - fs browser: only one level expanded. need drastic new algorithm.
  - commands->copy path, copy file list, paste path
  - much better autocomplete
  - aliases
  - pre-load open and search dialogs in background thread, and cache
    them
  - better permissions API
  - show wait cursor while directory is loading
  - Two-pane 'file system commander' window, with copy/move buttons
  - recursive directory delete
  - easier way for plugins to add right-click menu commands
  - directory chooser dialog box
  - keyboard select file should activate open files -- or Enter press
- clickable stack traces in activity log
- JOptionPane: try adding keyboard mnemonics for no -vs- cancel?
  + more intuitive button labels throughout
- incremental search; find all occurrences that are visible
- if caps lock is pressed during startup, show dialog box for changing
  settings that are currently set on the CLI (settings directory,
  flags such as -norestore, background mode)
- show 'this was shown cos caps lock down', blah blah so users don't
  get confused.
- 'Go to Log' button; opens relevant exception in activity log
- 'Go to Log' button in beanshell error dialog box too
- click on plugin in plugin manager to see the error that caused it to
  not load
- drop LatestVersion plugin
- roll Firewall plugin into core
- web start version
- selective undo
- <file>?line= or ?marker=
- persistent fold visibility option
- fold navigator to browse fold tree in explicit fold mode
- command to surround selection with explicit fold markers
- search & replace: option to skip folded lines
- complete word: update on the fly as chars typed
- reintroduce -bshclient command line switch
- complete word: custom WrapAroundJList control
- jEdit 3.1 seems slower than 3.0. Folding-related code needs to be
  optimized? Also faster scrolling.
- plugin size reporting, new install plugins dialog UI layout
- saving a read-only file: show a confirmation dialog box
- ant targets to replace mk_installer/mk_source scripts
- tool bar option pane: editing existing entries
- version number in splash screen
- mode-specific context menu and maybe even tool bar
- frame.setState(Frame.NORMAL);
- line-uncomment command
- search and replace of specific token types only
- complete-word: complete current mode's keywords
- recording 'evaluate for selected lines'
- rollover toolbar buttons option
- when loading plugins and such, check for settingsDir == jEditHome
- some means of redirecting double-clicks on a file to a VFS
- improve next/prev-word commands
- option on JDK 1.4 to have the LnF decorate windows and dialogs
- search and replace: scroll text area so selection is visible despite
  dialog position
- better auto indent
- caret beyond end of line
- graphical regular expression editor
- appendix in plugin guide on contributing plugins
- when loading a file: if the stream supports a mark, read first 16 bytes,
  check for unicode byte order mark, push back, if one is found, set
  encoding to Unicode automatically
- hypersearch:
  - show replace results in search results window
  - new search results window for each search, no 'search results' menu
    item
- smarter/better userInput() that accepts strings, not just characters
- option pane API changes:
  - boolean validate() method added; if returns false, user is not allowed
    to close dialog with 'OK' button, have to either fix values or cancel.
  - OptionsDialog handles selective initialization of option panes;
    AbstractOptionPane's _init() and _save() methods no longer necessary
    and deprecated.
- new token types:
  - MARKUP renamed MARKUP1
  - MARKUP2
  - MARKUP3
  - MARKUP4
  - KEYWORD4 (in addition to KEYWORD[123])
  - INLINE (for inline scripts)
- HTML mode:
  - inside tags, delegate on*="..." to JavaScript mode,
    style="..." to CSS mode
  - better <script>/<style> handling using nested delegates
- this might be too hard: DELEGATE_TYPE attribute of SPAN rule, defines
  token type from which default attributes are obtained for all tokens
  inside the SPAN. eg, if a rule delegates to the javascript mode, with a
  DELEGATE_TYPE of INLINE, and INLINE is defined as a light-gray background,
  all tokens in the JavaScript source that do not define a background color
  will be drawn with a light-gray background.
- save markers when a buffer is closed, adding/removing markers shouldn't
  set the dirty flag
- per-mode encodings and line separators, to optionally override those
  auto-detected when a buffer is loaded
- they should be overridable on a global basis too
- if last token of a line has a background color, remainder of line will
  be drawn with that color
- improve rectangular selection:
  - shift-left/shift-right: behave differently with rectangular selection
  - 'fill' command
  - 'vertical paste' command
  - selection past end of line
  - treat a tab like n spaces, not one character
  - replace in selection with rectangular selections
- keymaps replace .shortcut properties
  - loaded from $HOME/.jedit/keymaps, and jedit.jar
  - one keymap can 'extend' another
  - keymaps are XML files with <bind>, <unbind> tags
  - jEdit, emacs, keymaps included, maybe others
  - instead of hard-coded modifier swapping on MacOS, have a MacOS keymap
- dockable view registers window
  - RegisterChanged message added
  - update display when shown register changes
  - use a timer to update display of $ register every 5 seconds or so
  - use a timer to update display of % register if it is a ClipboardRegister
- store register contents in ~/.jedit/registers.xml
- ScrollBarHighlight interface:
  Color getColor()
  int[] getHighlightedLines()
  String getToolTipText(int line)
- Used by ErrorList, HyperSearch, markers
- use java2d to draw block caret (instead of XOR)
- cache plugin list in plugin manager, only loading it from the server if
  the modification date has changed?
- work thread hang?
- when a new text area is created, if caret is on a bracket, not matched
  initially
- resizing doesn't update horizontal scroll bar
- JDK 1.3: about box broken
- find next with $ or ^
- Shift+TAB on Java 1.1
- custom stylesheet: no xmlns
- eval-for-selected-lines doesn't work with rectangular selection
- how to handle S+0-9?
- if start is at the end of a line, .* always matches an empty string
- formatting problems in user's guide in table cells
- finish persistent splits code
- complete word: keys to navigate don't work with some Java versions
- don't do #save# stuff if destination directory is not writeable
- installing source for already installed plugins is not possible
- directory search: continue even if a file can't be loaded
- a line consisting entirely of spaces & word wrap
- switching option panes real fast
- fix '... is not a function name' when running openjade
- tabbing to text area fails
- zlib decompression errors in plugin manager
- failed saves should not clear the dirty flag
- get rid of final blank page of user's guide
- aborts not always fired
- macro guide: JOptionPane not a good idea for getting user input?
- globalColors setting:
  - tree controls, file system browser icons, tool bar icons look a bit
    ugly with different backgrounds
  - help viewer looks ugly
  - selected borders in list, tree, table wrong colors
  - updateUI doesn't update tree colors
  - restart should not be necessary for 'globalColors' to take effect
- 'Stop' in plugin manager needs to be handled more gracefully
- binding an action to ` doesn't work
- evalutate for selected lines: > 1 selection per line
- folding paint up bug
- prev line fold gutter bug
- undo: redo doesn't clear dirty flag if necessary
- BrowserView.reloadDirectory(): hardcoded design decisions
