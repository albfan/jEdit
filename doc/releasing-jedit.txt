Packaging jEdit for release
==================================================

This document contains/will contain instructions on how to create and release jEdit for distribution, with all of the installers.

When releasing jEdit, we use the "ant dist" target, which builds installers for different operating systems.

Filename Conventions
--------------------

The naming conventions of the target must be consistent with previous releases. Here is an example of how it *should* be with release 4.3pre6.

 	jedit_4.3pre6_all.deb 	Platform-Independent  	.deb
  	jedit4.3pre6.dmg 	Platform-Independent 	.dmg
  	jedit4.3pre6installer.exe 	i386 	.exe (32-bit Windows)
    jedit4.3pre6install.jar   	Platform-Independent 	.jar * NOTE - pjo.py needs this.
      	jedit4.3pre6source.tar.bz2
  	jedit4.3pre6manual-A4.pdf
  	jedit4.3pre6manual-USletter.pdf
  	jedit-4.3pre6-noarch-1sao.tgz


NOTE: This is not consistent with previous releases... Is it too late to make it so?

Windows Installer
-----------------

To build the Windows installer, you need the following things:


Mac Installer
-------------

To build the Mac installer, you need the following things:



Debian Installer
----------------

To build the debian installer, you need the following things:



Upload Step #1
--------------

After building the files, we upload them to the sf.net upload site.

    ncftp ftp://upload.sf.net/incoming
    Login successful.
    Logged in to upload.sf.net.
    Current remote directory is /incoming.
    ncftp /incoming > mput jedit*

File Release System
-------------------

Next, we add and describe the files for sourceforge.net's file release system.

http://sourceforge.net/project/admin/editpackages.php?group_id=588

For "pre" releases, we add files to the "devel" release.


After Releasing
---------------

After the file has been released, we need to update the website in the following places:

sftp://plugins.jedit.org//home/groups/j/je/jedit/htdocs/download.text
sftp://plugins.jedit.org//home/groups/j/je/jedit/htdocs/jEdit-version.txt

Wiz
---

Finally, go to plugins.jedit.org/wiz and create the release there, so that future releases of plugins can depend on it.
