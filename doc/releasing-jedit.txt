==================================================
Packaging jEdit for release
==================================================

This document contains/will contain instructions on how to create and release jEdit for distribution, with all of the installers.

The analogous document for releasing plugins is in the jedit SVN repository under the name "pjo/doc/pjo.txt".

Building Instructions
=====================
Before you read this document, be sure to read first the README.SRC.txt, in the parent directory. It contains instructions on how to get and set up Apache Ant, what the targets mean, and what you need to build each kind of package.

When releasing jEdit, we use the "ant dist" target, which builds installers for different operating systems.

Filename Conventions
--------------------

The naming conventions of the target must be consistent with previous releases. Here is an example of how it should be with release 4.3pre7 (please note that pre5-pre6 need to be renamed at some point).

 	jedit4.3pre7.deb 	Platform-Independent  	.deb
  	jedit4.3pre7.dmg 	Platform-Independent 	.dmg
  	jedit4.3pre7install.exe 	i386 	.exe (32-bit Windows)
    jedit4.3pre7install.jar   	Platform-Independent 	.jar * NOTE - pjo.py needs this.
    jedit4.3pre7source.tar.bz2
  	jedit4.3pre7manual-a4.pdf
  	jedit4.3pre7manual-letter.pdf
  	jedit-4.3pre7-noarch-1sao.tgz  Platform-Independent slackware package


Upload Step #1
--------------

After building the files, we upload them to the sf.net upload site.

    ncftp ftp://upload.sf.net/incoming
    Login successful.
    Logged in to upload.sf.net.
    Current remote directory is /incoming.
    ncftp /incoming > mput jedit*

File Release System
-------------------

Next, we add and describe the files for sourceforge.net's file release system.

http://sourceforge.net/project/admin/editpackages.php?group_id=588

For "pre" releases, we add files to the "devel" release.


After Releasing
---------------

After the file has been released, we need to update the website in the following places:

sftp://plugins.jedit.org//home/groups/j/je/jedit/htdocs/download.text
sftp://plugins.jedit.org//home/groups/j/je/jedit/htdocs/jEdit-version.txt


Announcement
------------

Send an announcement to the jedit-devel list and jedit-announce list.  The announcement should contain the contents of the CHANGES.txt file in the jedit subversion repository under jedit/doc.  When you send the email to jedit-announce, please do it from your normal email address.  If you do it from one that looks like "joshuatiggonzalez@grsymphony.org" it'll get lost with all the spam we get to that list.  Yes, that's a real example.

Wiz
---

Finally, go to plugins.jedit.org/wiz and create the release there, so that future releases of plugins can depend on it.
