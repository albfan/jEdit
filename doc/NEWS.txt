OVERVIEW OF CHANGES BETWEEN JEDIT 3.2 AND 4.0

jEdit 4.0 is a significant upgrade to 3.2; the major version number has
been increased as several parts of the editor have been rewritten for
improved performance, reduced memory footprint, and greater possibility
for future extension.

* Incompatible changes

- jEdit now requires Java 2 version 1.3 or later. It will no longer work
  with Java 1.1 or Java 2 version 1.2. Also, some aspects of the plugin
  API have changed; make sure your installed plugins are their latest
  versions.

- If you added macros to the context menu or tool bar, or assigned
  shortcuts to macros using jEdit 3.2.2 or earlier, you will need to
  recreate those settings after upgrading to jEdit 4.0 since the way
  macros are handled internally has changed.

- Clicking the middle mouse button no longer inserts the most recently
  selected text by default. This can be enabled in the 'Text Area' pane
  of the Utilities->Global Options dialog box.

- Two minor changes to the default shortcuts:

  S+BACK_SPACE is now CS+BACK_SPACE (Delete to Start of Line)
  S+DELETE is now CS+DELETE (Delete to End of Line)

* Major user-visible changes

- Rewritten buffer code: this results in decreased footprint, faster
  file loading, _much_ faster directory search, and more.

- Rewritten folding code. Fold visibility can now be changed on a
  per-text area basis, and "explicit" folding (where the buffer is
  parsed for "{{{" and "}}}") is now supported, in addition to the old
  "indent" folding. Plugins can add their own folding modes as well.

- Soft wrap has been added. The old "hard" wrap is still present as a
  configurable option.

- Bracket matching now indicates the bracket scope in the gutter.

- Many improvements in the file system browser, among them coloring of
  the file list based on file name patterns, and persistent tree
  expansion state when a directory is reloaded.

- A framework is in place for context-sensitive editing features;
  currently, the commenting commands use it to behave differently
  depending on where the caret is positioned in a buffer, for example,
  in HTML text or inline JavaScript.

- The window docking feature has been improved in terms of functionality
  and appearance.

- Syntax highlighting has been added for the following file types:

  - ActionScript
  - BBj
  - BibTeX
  - Informix 4-GL
  - Modula-3
  - ObjectRexx
  - Prolog
  - SmallTalk

* Other user-visible improvements

There are many smaller improvements as well, too many to list here, but
some of the more noteworthy ones are:

- 'Complete Word' command now completes mode-specific keywords, in
  addition to previously typed text.

- Search and Replace usability improvements.

- Better integration with MacOS X; jEdit now knows about type and
  creator codes.

- Unicode files are automatically detected and opened as such.

- If "quick copy" is enabled, dragging with the middle mouse button
  creates a selection without moving the caret. When the mouse button is
  released the selected text is inserted at the caret position and the
  selection is deactivated.

  The quick copy feature is disabled by default, but can be enabled in
  the 'Text Area' pane of the Utilities->Global Options dialog box.

- The font used to display user interface elements can now be changed in
  the new 'Appearance' pane of the Utilities->Global Options dialog box.

- jEdit Frequently Asked Questions document, by John Gellene, is now
  included as part of the online help.

- jEdit now has better support for Java 2 version 1.4.

And of course, there is much, much more; see the CHANGES.txt file for a
full list.
