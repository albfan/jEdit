OVERVIEW OF CHANGES BETWEEN JEDIT 3.2 AND 4.0

*********** This file is not yet finished.

* Incompatible changes

jEdit now requires Java 2 version 1.3 or later. It will no longer work
with Java 1.1 or Java 2 version 1.2. Also, some aspects of the plugin
API have changed; make sure your installed plugins are their latest
versions.

* Rewritten document model

Buffers are now stored in memory in a different manner; the Java
Document class is no longer used. This results in faster loading of
files, reduced memory consumption, and faster directory search.

* Soft wrap

Soft word wrapping is now available, where lines are automatically
wrapped as they are displayed without newlines being inserted. The old
"hard wrap" that would insert newlines is still available as a
configurable option.

Note that word wrap is now disabled by default; you must enable it
either in the Global Options or Buffer Options dialog boxes.

* Improved folding

The folding feature has been rewritten from scratch. The most important
change is that in addition to indent-based folding, there is also an
"explicit" fold mode that parses buffers for "{{{" and "}}}" sequences.

Another important change is that fold visibility can now be set on a
per-text area basis.

Note that folding is now disabled by default; you must enable it either
in the Global Options or Buffer Options dialog boxes.
