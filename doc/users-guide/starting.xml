  <para>
   Several conventions are used throughout jEdit's user interface and
   this manual. They will be described here. Macintosh users should note how their modifier keys map to the terms used in the manual.

 <sect1 id="starting-any-os"><title>Platform-Independent Instructions</title>
  <para>
   Exactly how jEdit is started depends on the operating system. For example, on Unix you can run <quote>jedit</quote> at the command line,
   or select jEdit from a menu; on Windows, you can
   use the jEditLauncher package, which is documented in
   <xref linkend="starting-windows" />.
  </para>
  <para>
   If jEdit is started while another copy is already running, control is
   transferred to the running copy, and a second instance is not loaded.
   This saves time and memory if jEdit is started multiple times.
   Communication between instances of jEdit is implemented using
   TCP/IP sockets; the initial instance is known as the
   <firstterm>server</firstterm>, and subsequent invocations are
   <firstterm>clients</firstterm>.
  </para>
  <para>
   If the <userinput>-background</userinput> command line switch is specified,
   jEdit will continue running and waiting for client requests even
   after all editor windows are closed. When run in background mode,
   you can open and close jEdit any number of times, only having
   to wait for it to start the first time. The downside of this
   is that jEdit will continue to consume memory when no windows
   are open.
  </para>
  <para>
   When running on MacOS X, the <userinput>-background</userinput> command-line switch is active by default, so that jEdit conforms to the platform convention that programs should stay open until the <guimenuitem>Quit</guimenuitem> command is explicitly invoked by the user, even if all windows are closed. To disable background mode on MacOS X, use the <userinput>-nobackground</userinput> switch.
  </para>
  <para>
   For more information about command line switches that control the
   server feature, see <xref linkend="cli-usage" />.
   Note that if you are using <application>jEditLauncher</application>
   to start jEdit on Windows, this switch cannot be specified on the
   MS-DOS prompt command line when starting jEdit; it must be set as described
   in <xref linkend="launcher-starting" />.
  </para>
  <para>
   jEdit remembers open buffers, views and split window configurations between editing sessions, so you can get back to work immediately after starting jEdit. This feature can be
   disabled in the <guibutton>General</guibutton> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</guimenuitem>
   dialog box see <xref linkend="general-pane" />.
  </para>
  <sidebar><title>The edit server and security</title>
   <para>
    Not only does the server pick a random TCP port number on startup,
    it also requires that clients provide an <firstterm>authorization
    key</firstterm>; a randomly-generated number only accessible to
    processes running on the local machine.
    So not only will <quote>bad guys</quote> have to guess a 64-bit integer,
    they will need to get it right on the first try; the edit server
    shuts itself off upon receiving an invalid packet.
   </para>
   <para>
    In environments that demand absolute security, the edit server can be
    disabled by specifying the <userinput>-noserver</userinput> command line switch.
   </para>
  </sidebar>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="starting-windows"><title>Starting jEdit on Windows</title>
  <para>
   On Windows, jEdit comes with <emphasis>jEditLauncher</emphasis> - an optional
   package of components that make it easy to start jEdit, manage its command
   line settings, and launch files and macro scripts.
  </para>

  <para>
   The jEditLauncher package provides three shortcuts for running jEdit:  one in
   the desktop's <guilabel>Start</guilabel> menu, a entry in the Programs menu, and
   a third shortcut on your desktop.  Any of these may be deleted or moved without
   affecting jEdit's operation.  To launch jEdit, simply select one of these shortcuts
   as you would for any Windows application.
  </para>

  <para>
   The jEditLauncher package includes a utility for changing the command line
   parameters that are stored with jEditLauncher and used every time it runs jEdit.
   You can change the Java interpreter used to launch jEdit, the amount of heap memory,
   the working directory and other command line parameters.  To make these changes,
   select <guilabel>Set jEdit Parameters</guilabel> from the jEdit group in
   the Programs menu, or run <userinput>jedit /p</userinput> from a command
   line that has jEdit's installation directory in its search path.  A dialog
   will appear that allows you to change and save a new set of command line
   parameters.
  </para>

  <para>
   The package also adds menu items to the context or <quote>right-click</quote>
   menu displayed by the Windows shell when you click on a file item in the
   desktop window, a Windows Explorer window or a standard file selection dialog.
   The menu entries allow  you to open selected files in jEdit, starting the
   application if necessary. It will also allow you to open all files in a
   directory with a given extension with a single menu selection. If a BeanShell
   macro script with a <filename>.bsh</filename> extension is selected, the menu
   includes the option of running that script within jEdit. If you have the
   <application>JDiff</application> plugin installed with jEdit, you can also
   select two files and have jEdit compare them in a side-by-side graphical display.
  </para>

  <para>
   For a more detailed description of all features found in
   the jEditLauncher package, see <xref linkend="launcher-guide"/>.
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="cli-usage"><title>Command Line Usage</title>
  <para>
   On operating systems that support a command line, jEdit can be passed
   various arguments to control its behavior.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you are using <application>jEditLauncher</application>
   to start jEdit on Windows, only file names can be specified
   on the command line; the parameters documented below must be set as described
   in <xref linkend="launcher-starting" />.
  </para>
  <para>
   When opening files from the command line, a line number or marker to
   position the caret on can be specified like so:
  </para>
  <screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>jedit MyApplet.java +line:10</userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>jedit thesis.tex +marker:c</userinput></screen>
  <para>
   Command-line switches begin with a "-". Some take a parameter. A file whose name
   begins with "-" can be opened like so:
  </para>
  <screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>jedit -- -myfile</userinput></screen>
