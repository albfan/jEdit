Description: A real editor for programmers
 As one of the most feature rich editors available, jEdit boasts support for
 syntax highlighting in more than 140 languages. jEdit combines the power of
 Emacs, the user-friendliness of Kate, and the advanced editing features
 (such as vertical paste) of Ultraedit, to bring you an open-source
 plugin-based programmer's editor of professional quality.
 .
 It is possible to define complex macros in BeanShell or Jython, or other
 languages that fit into the BSF. jEdit offers a powerful and user-friendly
 keyboard mapping system, making it possible to give jEdit a very Emacs-like
 feel, if you so desire.
 .
 Its functionality is easily extended by the use of 'plugins' which can be
 downloaded, updated, and installed, all without exiting the editor. These
 include a built-in Console shell integration, which also lets you execute
 external commands and bind them to keyboard shortcuts, also without leaving
 the editor. Other plugins provide shells, structure browsers and/or
 completion popups for Ant, LaTeX, HTML, Java, XML, Ruby, Python, Perl, C,
 C++, bash, Scheme, Prolog, and many other languages. More information about
 jEdit, its plugins, macros, etc. can be found at http://www.jEdit.org/
