            How can I open files in jEdit using drag and drop?
        </para></question>
        <answer><para>
            Try installing the Drag and Drop plugin using the Plugin Manager
            feature. It works with most (but not all) combinations of operating
            systems and current Java runtime environments.

            How do I add and remove directories to the list of
            <quote>favorites</quote> in jEdit's File System Browser?
        </para></question>
        <answer><para>
            To add a directory to the list of favorites, navigate so that
            the directory is at the top of the tree displayed in the File System
            Browser window, click the <guimenuitem>More</guimenuitem> button (or
            right-click anywhere in the browser window), and select
            <guimenuitem>Add to favorites</guimenuitem> from the resulting menu.
            To delete a directory from the favorites list, use the same menu
            to go to the favorites list. Right-click on the directory to
            be deleted and select <guimenuitem>Delete</guimenuitem>.
            This operation will delete the directory from the list of
            favorites but will have no effect on the directory itself.

            How do I associate particular file types with jEdit so I can open them

        </para></question>
        <answer><para>
            If you are using jEditLauncher, you associate the file extension with
            <replaceable>[full path]</replaceable><userinput>\jedit.exe
            &quot;%1&quot;</userinput>.
        </para>
        <para>
            The jEditLauncher package for Windows includes a custom
            context menu handler.  It will provide menu items for
            using jEdit any time you right-click on a file icon in
            Windows Explorer or a Windows file menu.  This feature does
            not interfere with any existing file assocations.

            Can I restrict jEdit to opening and saving files in a single directory

        </para></question>
        <answer><para>
            The easiest way to get this kind of behavior is to use macros that open
            the Virtual File Browser to a specific, fixed directory, and then
            change the default keyboard shortcuts for opening and saving files to
            run these macros.

        <question id="filename-uc-to-lc"><para>
            On Windows, how can I change the name of my file from
            <filename>myfile.txt</filename> to <filename>MyFile.txt</filename>?
        </para></question>
        <answer><para>
            The Windows native file system deals with file names in a
            case-insensitive manner, so <filename>myfile.txt</filename> and
            <filename>MyFile.txt</filename> refer to the same file. As a result, the
            jEdit file browser treats both spellings identically and does not
            make a name change. Using our example, the easiest workaround is to
            rename the file in two steps: first to <filename>_myfile.txt</filename>,
            then to <filename>MyFile.txt</filename>.

        <answer><para>
            No. The feature is being planned for inclusion in a future
            jEdit version.  The fastest way to do this in the current
            jEdit version is to use the Console plugin and a native
            command.

        <answer><para>
            This is a problem in jEdit 3.2.2 that has been fixed in version 4.0.

        <question id="file-owner-preserve"><para>
            Does jEdit preserve file ownership and permissions when it
            saves files?
        </para></question>
        <answer><para>
          One reason this can be an issue is that by default, jEdit adopts the conservative
          approach of saving a file to a temporary name before renaming that file
          to the desired name. This procedure minimizes the risk of crashes
          causing loss of data, and works without reported problems on local file
          systems. However, when files are served remotely by FTP, Samba or other means,
          it may not be possible to preserve file attributes on the
          server because the newly created temporary file's owner may differ from
          the owner of the original file on the server.
        </para>
        <para>
          To avoid this problem, you can disable the two-step file saving routine. Select
          <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</guimenuitem>, then
          under <guimenuitem>Loading &amp; Saving</guimenuitem>, clear the checkbox for
          <guimenuitem>Two-stage save</guimenuitem>.

            characters when I save a file?
        </para></question>
        <answer><para>
            When jEdit saves an existing file, it uses the line separator
            already used by the file.  The line separator designated in the
            buffer options or elsewhere is used only for new files.
        </para></answer>
    </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
        <question id="file-autodetect-encoding"><para>
            Can jEdit auto-detect character encodings when it opens a file?
        </para></question>
        <answer><para>
            Only Unicode can be detected when a file is loaded. For other
            encodings, you must specify the encoding when the file is loaded
            if you do not wish to use the default
            encoding for your operating system.
        </para>
        <para>
            There are a few features that can help you navigate through encoding
            issues. By selecting <guimenu>File</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Open With
            Encoding</guimenuitem>, you can open a file with a specified encoding.
            You can also designate a default encoding in the <guimenuitem>Loading
            &amp; Saving</guimenuitem> pane of the Global Options dialog; if you do
            not, jEdit adopts your operating's system default encoding as its own
            default. You can change the encoding used to save an individual file by
            selecting <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Buffer
            Options</guimenuitem> and changing the current buffer's properties.
            Finally, jEdit keeps track of the encodings used in the files named in
            the <guimenu>File</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Recent Files</guimenuitem>
            drop-down list.
         </para>
         <para>
            These features allow you to minimize the attention given to character
            encodings, but you must still pay some attention if you do not want
            to use default settings.

      </para></question>
      <answer><para>
        You need to use instead the iso-8859-15 character set, which is a modification
        of iso-8859-1 that includes the Euro sign and some Finnish and French characters.
        The Euro sign represents character value 0xA4 in this 8-bit set. To open a file
        manually using this encoding, select <guimenu>File</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Open
        With Encoding</guimenuitem>, and select <guimenuitem>ISO8859_15</guimenuitem>.

			The Lucida Console font does not come in a bold style. Various platforms and

	</question>
	<answer>
		<para>
			Prior to release of version 1.4 of the Java Development Kit (JDK), printing
      has been one of the weak
      areas of the Java platform. If you are using JDK version 1.3, here
      are a few suggestions on improving pritning performance.

    <para>
			One simple way to improve printing is to use the InfoViewer plugin to display and
      print a text file in your favorite Web browser. You can also write a macro that
      saves a buffer and then passes the buffer's file name (using the method
			<filename>buffer.getPath()</filename>) to an external print utility. The file
			<filename>prettyprint.bat</filename> in the
			Downloads section of <ulink url="http://community.jedit.org">jEdit
			Community</ulink> is an example of this approach using a
			Windows batch file and Ghostscript. You can then change the
			<keycombo action="simul"><keycap>CTRL</keycap><keycap>P</keycap></keycombo>

          A dialog will appear for entering text that goes before and after the

          Use the mouse to select <guilabel>Add global</guilabel> or <guilabel>Add
          mode-specific</guilabel>. The first choice makes the abbreviation
          available for all documents; the second makes it available only in
          documents with the same editing mode as the current document. In this
          way, you can add abbreviations that operate only a particular class of
