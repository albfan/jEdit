OVERVIEW OF CHANGES BETWEEN JEDIT 4.0 AND 4.1

jEdit 4.1 improves on many aspects of jEdit 4.0. It fills in some gaps
in 4.0's feature set, and significantly improves usability, stability
and performance.

* Incompatible changes

- Older versions of some plugins might be incompatible with jEdit 4.1.
  Ensure you are running the latest set.

- Wheel mouse scrolling support for Java 1.4 is now built-in; if you
  previously installed the WheelMouse plugin, remove it.

- Changes to indent on tab, indent on enter

- Next/prev word flag change

- smart home/end change

* User interface

- Improved menu bar layout and Utilities->Global Options dialog box
  usability.

- jEdit now remembers if windows were maximized across sessions when
  running on Java 1.4.

- The View->Unsplit Current command removes the currently focused split
  from the view. Other splits are left intact (unlike View->Unsplit All).

- The View->New Plain View command opens a new view without any tool
  bars or docked windows.

- The View->Docking menu now contains commands for moving keyboard focus
  to the four docking areas and the text area.

  The commands for closing each of the four docking areas have been
  merged into a single command that closes the currently focused docking
  area.

- -float actions for dockables

- The status bar now displays the word wrap mode and the line separator.

  The contents of the status bar can be customized in the Status Bar
  pane of the Utilities->Global Options dialog box.

- The online help is now fully searchable.

* Text editing

- 10 new syntax modes (as of 4.1pre6)
- regexp syntax matching, AT_WORD_START, AT_WHITESPACE_END, digit
  changes, EOL_SPAN delegates, SEQ delegates, mention fixed Perl & HTML
- better Java auto indent
- better rect select

* Search and replace

- Directory search can now be performed over virtual file systems.

- The HyperSearch Results window can optionally retain previous search
  results.

- HyperSearch within a rectangular selection is now supported.

- The search bar is now hidden by default. The quick search commands
  make it visible, and pressing ESCAPE hides it.

  If you prefer the old behavior where the search bar was always
  visible, specify so in the General pane of the Utilities->Global
  Options dialog box.

* File system browser

- fsb browser: dialog field auto-complete, parent dir right click,
  multi select, open in new view/new split, better encoding handling

* Macro system

- updated BSH to 1.2b6, scriptPath variable, user & system macro dir
  merge
- startup scripts in any language

* Plugin manager

- Categorized plugin manager, select all
- SOCKS proxy support.

And of course, there is much, much more; see the CHANGES.txt file for a
full list.
