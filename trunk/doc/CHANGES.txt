  read-only. (Eric Le Lay # 2805986)

  in status bar. (Matthieu Casanova)

  TextArea#setDragInProgress(). (SF.net patch #2809776,2936146 - Kevin Hunter)

- EditBus.send() will now always deliver messages on the AWT thread, although
  it can be called from any thread. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Added EditBus.sendAsync(): this just enqueues messages to be send over
  the EditBus as soon as the AWT thread is not busy, and returns immediately.
   (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Added ability to tag classes with EditBus.EBHandler. This is only useful
  when tagging an EditPlugin class, and makes the plugin instance behave
  as if it implemented EBComponent (it's added to the bus when the plugin
  is activated). (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Temporary buffers do not send BufferUpdate.PROPERTIES_CHANGED messages anymore
  (patch #2932330) (Dale Anson)

- RFC edit mode was misplaced in catalog and was never matching anything because
  text edit mode glob was more global and checked first (Matthieu Casanova)

  (Matthieu Casanova)

- PluginUpdate bus message now have a method getPluginVersion() that returns
  the plugin version if there is one (Matthieu Casanova #2953163)

- Added StyleEditor.invokeForCaret(textArea) which does same as
  buffer.editSyntaxStyle(textArea) did, but can be invoked without
  specifying the buffer object carefully. (Kazutoshi Satoda)

}}}

  no edit mode, the edit mode from the source is copied (Matthieu Casanova)

- Added the missing doxygen commands for doxygen v1.6.1
  (bug #2895272 - report and patch from Bernhard Walle).

  data from clipboard, currently plain text, rich jEdit text
  (plain text + edit mode) and mime type html are supported (Matthieu Casanova)

}}}
{{{ Miscellaneous

- It is now possible to copy several files in the VFS Browser at the same time,
  and copy from/to the OS explorer (Matthieu Casanova)

- Removed LatestVersion plugin.

- Added actions for eating whitespace at word ends in both directions
  for findWordStart. (#1953341 - strank)

- Added a configurable selection foreground color. If set, this color will be
  used for the selection foreground instead of the syntax highlighting color.
  The new option can be set from Global Options -> Text Area.
  (Shlomy Reinstein)

- Implemented feature request #2919875: Namable views. You can now specify a
  name for each view using View -> Set view title. The name is persistent in the
  perspective.xml file.

- In Hypersearchs result panel, the query string length is now limited to 100
  chars by default for display (Matthieu Casanova)

- Applied patch #2887520: Allow filtering the recent file list using file globs,
  e.g. "*.java" or "{*.c,*.h}". (Patch provided by Joerg Spieler)

- New status bar widget design (Matthieu Casanova #1540560)

- New Encodings option pane using drag & drop (Matthieu Casanova)

- Parsing buffer local properties is limited to the first 10000 characters of
  the first and last 10 lines. This is a performance enhancement when loading
  buffers containing very long lines (Matthieu Casanova)

. Added a new option to perform font substitution in the text area when the
  current configured font can't display characters in the buffer. It's disabled
  by default, and can be enabled in the text area option pane, along with the
  option to choose preferred fonts for substitution. This makes reading files
  which contain text in multiple scripts more bearable. (Marcelo Vanzin)

- Fixed ModeCatalogHandler so if an edit mode in the user-specific catalog has
  the same name as an edit mode in the system catalog, the version in the
  user-specific catalog will override the system default.  This is what the
  documentation for writing an edit mode has stated is true for some time, now
  it is. (Dale Anson)
  
- Gave better priorities within modes which matches with a file at the
  same time, as the following order.

   - both the filename glob and the first line glob
   - only the filename glob
   - the first line glob  (Dale Anson)

- In status bar option pane, when adding a widget only widgets that are not
  already in the bar will be proposed (Matthieu Casanova feature #2937286)

- Added jedit.exe in the Windows installer, so that users can invoke
  jEdit more like a native application.
  (Feature Request #2661227, Patch #2984552 - Hisateru Tanaka)
