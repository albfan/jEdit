{{{ Miscellaneous

- The EditingOptionPane has now an option to remember the user choice about large file
  treatment (Matthieu Casanova)

- Removed 192mb heap size limit from startup scripts.
  Removed jedit.l4j.ini from Windows package files because no options were left.
  NOTE:
    Old jedit.l4j.ini won't be removed on upgrade. In that case, manual
    removal will be required. Please look for jedit.l4j.ini in the
    install directory after running the installer. If you found only
    "-Xmx192M" in the file, you can remove it or the file itself.

- OS/2 tasks were removed from the Java installer as OS/2 does not
  have a working Java 6 implementation and probably never will have
  (Björn "Vampire" Kautler)

- jEdit support for keymaps (Matthieu Casanova)

- User Settings directory migrated to %APPDATA%/jEdit on Windows
  (#2510763 - Alan Ezust)
  
- Added support for "Find Previous" when searching in multiple files (Evan Wright)
