JEDIT 4.0 VERSION HISTORY

* Version 4.0pre1

+ New Features

- Ant is used instead of jmk to compile jEdit

- If you are using the Metal or Kunststoff L&F, the UI control font can
  be changed in Utilities->Global Options->Appearance
- 'Vertical Paste' macro (Andre Kaplan)

  'Expand Folds With Level' and specifying a level of 1
- File listings in the file system browser are now colorized. Change the
  colors in Utilities->Global Options->File System Browser
- When a file is loaded, jEdit now remembers if it contained a trailing

  trailing newline would always be written, regardless of it being
  present in the file on disk or not

  BeanShell expression for each selected line, replacing the contents of
  that line with the return value of the expression

  of indent

- If a selection ends at the beginning of a line, that line is no longer
  considered to be part of the selection by line manipulation commands
- Improved window docking feature:

    remembers which dockables were open automatically

  recent files
- Fixed a NullPointerException if the 'Narrow to Selection' command
  was invoked with no selection
- JCheckBoxList typo prevented it from working in the XML plugin

  generate user input, but jEdit ignored Alt key strokes that were not
  bound to shortcuts.

- History text field border wasn't repainted after the model was changed

  jEdit.getFontProperty(String name);
  jEdit.getFontProperty(String name, Font def);
  jEdit.setFontProperty(String name, Font value);
  jEdit.getColorProperty(String name);
  jEdit.getColorProperty(String name, Color def);
  jEdit.setColorProperty(String name, Color value);

- jEdit.addAction() method removed. Plugins not using the jEdit 3.0
  action API will need to be updated.
