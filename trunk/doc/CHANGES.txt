JEDIT 4.2 VERSION HISTORY

{{{ Version 4.2pre1

Thanks to Kris Kopicki and Ryan Grove for contributing to this release.

{{{ Editing

- Quick copy now more consistent with usual mouse behavior:

  - Control-middle-clicking on a bracket will insert the contents of the
    bracketed block at the caret position.

  - Shift-middle-clicking at a point will insert text from the caret to
    the point at the caret position. Can be used to duplicate a line,
    for example.

- Register contents are now saved across editing sessions in
  ~/.jedit/registers.xml.

}}}
{{{ Input

- Entering a prefix while a JTextComponent has focus will move focus to
  the text area. This allows shortcuts like C+e n n to be used from the
  search bar and such without having to prefix them with C+e C+e first.

}}}
{{{ Syntax Highlighting

- Improved C pre-processor syntax highlighting.

- Updated NSIS2 syntax highlighting (Ryan Grove).

}}}
{{{ User Interface

- If regular expressions are enabled, Search->Find Previous now shows a
  dialog box message instead of silently searching forwards.

- Floating windows now have a bar across the top with a menu for docking
  the window.

- Right-clicking on a docked window button shows a menu for undocking
  the window, opening a cloned instance, and moving it to another
  docking area.

- Docking pane of Global Options dialog box removed because it is no
  longer necessary.

- Added an option to Appearance option pane to control menu spillover
  (default is 20 items).

- The title bar now indicates if the current buffer has been modified
  since the last save.

- Moved plugin option panes to a new Plugins->Plugin Options dialog box.

}}}
{{{ Scripting

- BeanShell scripts now preset the 'wm' variable to
  view.getDockableWindowManager(). Useful for actions.xml.

}}}
{{{ Optimizations

- Faster buffer loading.

- Faster activity log.

- Bracket matching is now only performed 200ms after the last caret
  movement. This should solve the problem of annoyingly slow response
  when eg, inserting a number of characters before an unclosed bracket
  near the beginning of a large source file.

- Consecutive "chunks" with the same style attributes were previously
  merged when a line was being painted, for improved performance. Now we
  take this one step further and merge them when putting a line's chunk
  list in the cache. This should improve scrolling performance,
  especially when smooth text is on.

}}}
{{{ Platform-Specific Changes:

- MacOS plugin version 3.0 now requires Java 1.4.1. All native calls now
  use the Cocoa API, and a dock menu has been added. The dock menu
  provides similar functionality to the plugin menu (Kris Kopicki).

}}}
{{{ Bug Fixes

- jEdit no longer minimizes and then restores windows when files are
  opened through the edit server on windows. This was done to work
  around an apparent bug in the Windows JRE. If you still experience the
  problem, execute this BeanShell code:

  jEdit.setBooleanProperty("server.brokenToFront",true);

- Some HTTP proxies decompress GZip streams for whatever reason. The
  plugin manager now checks if the stream starts with the GZip magic
  characters; if not, it parses it without decompression, instead of
  throwing an exception.

- Multiple monitors should work properly now (Kris Kopicki).

- Selecting "Search in Directory" from the right-click menu of a
  directory in the parent directories list would search in the wrong
  directory.

- Fixed problems with bracket matching not being activated when
  switching between split panes.
