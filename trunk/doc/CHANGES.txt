JEDIT 4.2 VERSION HISTORY

{{{ Version 4.2pre1

Thanks to Bill McMilleon, Kris Kopicki, Oliver Rutherfurd. Rudi Widmann
and Ryan Grove for contributing to this release.

{{{ Editing

- Quick copy now more consistent with usual mouse behavior:

  - Control-middle-clicking on a bracket will insert the contents of the
    bracketed block at the caret position.

  - Shift-middle-clicking at a point will insert text from the caret to
    the point at the caret position. Can be used to duplicate a line,
    for example.

- Register contents are now saved across editing sessions in
  ~/.jedit/registers.xml.

- Complete Word popup now has keyboard shortcuts (1 - 0) for inserting
  the first 10 elements in the list.

- Entering a prefix while a JTextComponent has focus will move focus to
  the text area. This allows shortcuts like C+e n n to be used from the
  search bar and such without having to prefix them with C+e C+e first.

- Previously, a Control-click on a bracket scope would select the
  bracketed expression. Now, a Shift-click selects the expression and a
  Control-click narrows to the expression.

- Previously setting the wrap margin to zero with soft wrap on would
  wrap to the width of the text area. This is no longer supported.

- The text area now scrolls by screen lines, not by physical lines, when
  soft wrap is enabled. The previous behavior resulted in simpler code
  but was extremely counter-intuitive.

- Right-clicking in the text area with no selection (or if multiple
  selection mode is enabled) moves the caret to the clicked line before
  displaying the popup menu (Rudi Widmann).

}}}
{{{ Rectangular Selection

- Changed vertical paste behavior. Now if the rectangle we are inserting
  into has more lines than the pasted text, the pasted text cycles
  through the rectangle. Previously, it would be inserted at the top
  with the remaining lines blank. The new behavior is very convinient;
  for example, you can select a zero-width rectangle and paste "final"
  to mark a set of variables in Java source as being final.

- Control-clicking in virtual space inserts the appropriate amount of
  white space and moves the caret there (Rudi Widmann).

- After invoking Edit->More Selection->Rectangular Selection,
  rectangular selections can be created from the keyboard using Shift in
  conjunction with a caret movement command.

}}}
{{{ Syntax Highlighting

- A new default color scheme.

- Added a new more token types: COMMENT3, COMMENT4, LITERAL3, LITERAL4,
  KEYWORD4.

- AT_LINE_START, AT_WORD_START and AT_WHITESPACE_END attributes can now
  be set independently for BEGIN and END tags of a SPAN.

- The default background color of a token is now the background color of
  the current ruleset's default token type. It now only defaults to the
  text area background if the ruleset's default token type does not have
  a background color. This matters because for example if COMMENT2 has a
  background but MARKUP does not, HTML markup in Javadocs now has the
  same background as the rest of the comment.

- Any groups matched by a SPAN_REGEXP's BEGIN sequence are substituted
  into any positional parameters in the END sequence. This allows
  read-ins to be properly handled in languages like Shell Script, PHP,
  and Perl.

- Added JCL and SAS syntax highlighting (Bill McMilleon).

- Improved C pre-processor syntax highlighting.

- Updated NSIS2 syntax highlighting (Ryan Grove).

- Parrot syntax highlighting (Oliver Rutherfurd).

}}}
{{{ Folding

- Different syntax styles are used for collapsed fold lines with
  different fold levels. Fold levels 1, 2 and 3 have distinct styles,
  and all higher levels are assigned another style.

- Alt-clicking on a fold triangle in the gutter narrows to that fold.

}}}
{{{ Action Bar

- Utilities->Action Bar (shortcut C+ENTER) shows the action bar, for
  quickly invoking editor commands and changing settings from the
  keyboard.

- Enter an action name (or a substring) to invoke that action.
  Completion popups are shown after a brief delay.

- Enter a repeat count then invoke an action using any means to repeat
  that action.

- Enter "buffer.<prop>=<value>" to set the buffer-local property
  <prop> to <value>; for example, "buffer.tabSize=4" changes the
  curent buffer's tab size to 4.

- Enter "!buffer.<prop>=<value>" to set a buffer property on a global
  basis; for example, "!buffer.tabSize=4" changes the default tab size
  for all buffers to 4.

- Enter "<prop>=<value>" to set any other global property; for
  example, "view.showToolbar=false" hides the tool bar.

- Note that property names are undocumented. You can get a list using
  the Misc->Properties->jEdit Properties macro.

}}}
{{{ User Interface

- If regular expressions are enabled, Search->Find Previous now shows a
  dialog box message instead of silently searching forwards.

- Added an option to Appearance option pane to control menu spillover
  (default is 20 items).

- The title bar now indicates if the current buffer has been modified
  since the last save.

- Moved plugin option panes to a new Plugins->Plugin Options dialog box.

- Improved window docking.

  - Floating windows now have a bar across the top with a menu for
    docking the window.

  - Right-clicking on a docked window button shows a menu for undocking
    the window, opening a cloned instance, and moving it to another
    docking area.

  - Docking pane of Global Options dialog box removed because it is no
    longer necessary.

- Added Utilities->Repeat Last Action command, bound to C+SPACE.

- jEdit now remembers if more than one view was open, and if the view
  was split.

}}}
{{{ Scripting

- BeanShell scripts now preset the 'wm' variable to
  view.getDockableWindowManager(). Useful for actions.xml.

}}}
{{{ Miscellaneous

- Added -quit command-line parameter; quits an already running jEdit
  instance.

- Added -nobackground, -restore, -gui, -startupscripts, -plugins
  parameters. Previously only the negations of these existed.

- Symbolic links are no longer resolved in buffer path names. Opening
  two buffers both pointing to the same file on disk is still not
  allowed.

}}}
{{{ Optimizations

- Faster buffer loading.

- Faster activity log.

- Bracket matching is now only performed 200ms after the last caret
  movement. This should solve the problem of annoyingly slow response
  when eg, inserting a number of characters before an unclosed bracket
  near the beginning of a large source file.

- Bracket matching now only scans up to 10,000 lines.

- Consecutive "chunks" with the same style attributes were previously
  merged when a line was being painted, for improved performance. Now we
  take this one step further and merge them when putting a line's chunk
  list in the cache. This should improve scrolling performance,
  especially when smooth text is on.

- jEdit now performs much better when very long lines are present in a
  buffer.

- A funky little display optimization with monospaced fonts is now
  performed. In jEdit 4.1 this could be enabled with a hidden property,
  but now we detect if a monospaced font is actually in use.

- Faster line insertion and removal when there are collapsed folds below
  the insertion point.

- Faster painting of tokens with background colors. Previously if tokens
  defined a background color, there was a noticable lag when scrolling
  for example (at least with Java 1.4.1 on Linux). This no longer
  happends.

}}}
{{{ Platform-Specific

- MacOS plugin version 3.0 now requires Java 1.4.1. All native calls now
  use the Cocoa API, and a dock menu has been added. The dock menu
  provides similar functionality to the plugin menu (Kris Kopicki).

- Background mode is now enabled by default on MacOS, since this is the
  platform convention.

}}}
{{{ Bug Fixes

- jEdit no longer minimizes and then restores windows when files are
  opened through the edit server on windows. This was done to work
  around an apparent bug in the Windows JRE. If you still experience the
  problem, there is a hidden property that can be set with the action
  bar:

  C+ENTER server.brokenToFront=true

- Some HTTP proxies decompress GZip streams for whatever reason. The
  plugin manager now checks if the stream starts with the GZip magic
  characters; if not, it parses it without decompression, instead of
  throwing an exception.

- Multiple monitors should work properly now (Kris Kopicki).

- Selecting "Search in Directory" from the right-click menu of a
  directory in the parent directories list would search in the wrong
  directory.

- Fixed problems with bracket matching not being activated when
  switching between split panes.

- Not all keyboard shortcuts worked in the Complete Word popup.

- Closing a view did not close any cloned dockable windows.

- Page Up/Page Down commands now scroll by the correct amount when soft
  wrap is on.

- Fixed I/O thread deadlock that could manifest when using the FTP
  plugin.

- Fixed initial position of options dialog box divider.

- If the default edit mode had a tab size of 8, and the global default
  was 4, a buffer-local property specifying a tab size of 8  would be
  ignored.

- "Spaces To Tabs" didn't work with non-leading tabs.

}}}
{{{ API Changes

- Removed some methods which do not make any sense at all with the new
  display engine:

  JEditTextArea.virtualToPhysical()
  JEditTextArea.physicalToVirtual()
  JEditTextArea.getVirtualLineCount()
  JEditTextArea.xToOffset() (was already deprecated)
  JEditTextArea.offsetToX() (was already deprecated)

- The FoldVisibilityManager class has been replaced with a
  DisplayManager class; obtain an instance by calling
  JEditTextArea.getDisplayManager().

- The concept of "virtual line numbers" is gone.
  JEditTextArea.get/setFirstLine() now takes a vertical scroll bar
  position that takes hidden lines as well as lines split by soft wrap
  into account. Currently, no public API exists to covert between
  scroll line numbers and physical line numbers, however there is a new
  JEditTextArea.setFirstPhysicalLine() method.

- The following plugins are known to be broken:

  Background
  JDiff
  WhiteSpace
  XML

}}}
{{{ API Enhancements

- Added VFS.DirectoryEntryCompare class.

- Added View.goToBuffer() method. If the specified buffer is already
  visible in one of the view's edit panes, sends focus to that edit
  pane. Otherwise, calls setBuffer() on the current edit pane.
