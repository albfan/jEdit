The default behavior of the <b>C+LEFT</b> and <b>C+RIGHT</b> commands is to
stop both at the beginning and the end of each word. However this can be
changed by remapping these keystrokes to alternative actions whose names end
with <b>(Eat Whitespace)</b> in the <b>Shortcuts</b> pane of the
<b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Global Options</b> dialog box.
