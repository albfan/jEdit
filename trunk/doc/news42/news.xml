	<para>
		This section outlines the new deferred loading plugin API.
		Also see <xref linkend="common-api-changes"/>.
	</para>

	<para>
		Note that most plugins written for jEdit 4.1 and earlier will continue
		to work, however they will not take advantage of the new features of the
		plugin API outlined in this section.
	</para>

	<sect2><title>General Idea</title>

	<para>
		In jEdit 4.1 and earlier, plugins are always fully loaded at program
		startup, and unloaded at program shutdown. While the plugin loader and
		API was very simple as a result, this scheme had two main
		disadvantages:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>Having a large number of plugins generally slowed down
		jEdit startup, since many plugins performed a lot of lengthy
		initialization.
		Even if all plugins made their <function>start()</function>
		methods as quick as possible, there would still be the overhead of
		scanning the JAR files, loading the plugin classes, and so on.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem><para>There was no way to reload plugins in a running jEdit
		instance. This made plugin development and use of the plugin manager
		a bit cumbersome.</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
		Through a stroke of insight, one notices that the only
		functions called from most plugins' <function>start()</function>
		methods fall into two categories:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>Registration of virtual file systems, fold handlers,
		macro handlers, Console shells, SideKick parsers, ...</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem><para>Arbitriary initialization that only needs to be
		done when the plugin is first invoked by the user, and not at
		program startup.</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	
	<para>
		jEdit 4.2 moves the former task out of the <function>start()</function>
		method and into a file within the JAR that can be parsed quickly. This
		allows the plugin core class to only be loaded, and its
		<function>start()</function> method called, only when
		the plugin is first invoked.
	</para>
	
	<para>
		Also, plugins can now be loaded and unloaded at runtime. Note
		that in 4.2pre1, this code has not been fully implemented yet, so the
		only way of doing this is by calling BeanShell APIs. Look for a nice UI
		for this in the 4.2pre2 plugin manager.
	</para>
	
	</sect2>

	<sect2><title>EditPlugin Class Changes</title>
	
	<para>
		Documentation for the properties mentioned below, and their possible values,
		can be found in the
		documentation for the <ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/EditPlugin.html">EditPlugin</ulink> class.
	</para>

	<para>
		jEdit distinguishes between jEdit 4.1 and 4.2-style plugins by checking
		for the presence of a single property,
		<property>plugin.<replaceable>class
		name</replaceable>.activate</property>. If this property is present, the
		plugin is loaded using the new API.
	</para>

	<para>
		Since the plugin's menu might need to be displayed before its core class
		is fully loaded, there is a new way of specifying the plugin menu using
		properties; the <function>createMenuItems()</function> method of the
		<ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/EditPlugin.html">EditPlugin</ulink>
		class has been deprecated.
	</para>

	<para>
		For example, the jEdit 4.1 version of the QuickNotepad plugin had the
		following <function>createMenuItems()</function> method:
	</para>

	<programlisting>public void createMenuItems(Vector menuItems)
{
    menuItems.addElement(GUIUtilities.loadMenu("quicknotepad.menu"));
}</programlisting>

	<para>
		Additionally, the following two properties were defined in
		<filename>QuickNotepad.props</filename>:
	</para>

	<programlisting>quicknotepad.menu.label=QuickNotepad
quicknotepad.menu=quicknotepad - quicknotepad.choose-file \
    quicknotepad.save-file quicknotepad.copy-to-buffer</programlisting>

	<para>
		The jEdit 4.2 version of this plugin no longer has a
		<function>createMenuItems()</function> method, and instead defines the
		following property:
	</para>

	<programlisting>plugin.QuickNotepadPlugin.menu=quicknotepad \
    - \
    quicknotepad.choose-file \
    quicknotepad.save-file \
    quicknotepad.copy-to-buffer</programlisting>

	<para>
		Note that specifying a <property>.label</property> property for the menu
		is no longer necessary, as the label becomes the name of the plugin.
	</para>

	<para>
		Similarly, option panes should are now specified using properties, and
		the <function>createOptionPanes()</function> method of the
		<ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/EditPlugin.html">EditPlugin</ulink>
		class has been deprecated.
	</para>

	<para>
		In QuickNotepad's case, the <function>createOptionPanes()</function>
		method has been removed:
	</para>

	<programlisting>public void createOptionPanes(OptionsDialog od)
    {
        od.addOptionPane(new QuickNotepadOptionPane());
    }</programlisting>

	<para>
		The new properties look like this:
	</para>

	<programlisting>plugin.QuickNotepadPlugin.option-pane=quicknotepad
options.quicknotepad.code=new QuickNotepadOptionPane();</programlisting>

	</sect2>

	<sect2><title>Actions</title>
	
	<para>
		The syntax of the <filename>actions.xml</filename> file has not changed.
	</para>

	<para>
		A few methods of the <ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/EditAction.html">EditAction</ulink>
		class were made
		final, since these three values must be known even if the action
		instance in question has not been loaded:
	</para>
	
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para><function>getLabel()</function></para></listitem>
		<listitem><para><function>isToggle()</function></para></listitem>
		<listitem><para><function>getMouseOverText()</function></para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	
	<para>
		This change does not affect plugins that define actions using an
		<filename>actions.xml</filename> file. However, if your plugin creates
		action instances dynamically, you will need to make calls like the
		following instead of overriding these methods:
	</para>

	<programlisting>jEdit.setTemporaryProperty("<replaceable>action name</replaceable>.label",
    "<replaceable>Hello World</replaceable>");
jEdit.setTemporaryProperty("<replaceable>action name</replaceable>.toggle",
    "<replaceable>true or false</replaceable>");
jEdit.setTemporaryProperty("<replaceable>action name</replaceable>.mouse-over",
    "<replaceable>some string</replaceable>");</programlisting>

	<para>
		Make sure to use <function>jEdit.setTemporaryProperty()</function> and
		not <function>jEdit.setProperty()</function> since the latter will save
		the values to the user properties file, which is probably not what you
		want.
	</para>

	<para>
		The <function>jEdit.getActions()</function> method has been
		deprecated, since it must load all plugin <filename>actions.xml</filename>
		files in order to return an array of <ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/EditAction.html">EditAction</ulink>
		instances. Use <function>jEdit.getActionNames()</function> instead,
		which returns an array of strings.
	</para>

	<para>
		A new abstract method was added to the <ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/gui/InputHandler.html">InputHandler</ulink>
		class:
	</para>
	
	<para>
		<funcsynopsis>
		<funcprototype>
		<funcdef>void <function>addKeyBinding</function></funcdef>
		<paramdef>String <parameter>keyBinding</parameter></paramdef>
		<paramdef>String <parameter>action</parameter></paramdef>
		</funcprototype>
		</funcsynopsis>
	</para>

	</sect2>

	<sect2><title>Dockable Windows</title>
	
	<para>
		The syntax of the <filename>dockables.xml</filename> file has not changed.
	</para>

	<para>
		Instead of overriding the deprecated
		<function>JComponent.requestDefaultFocus()</function> method,
		dockable windows can now implement the new <ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/gui/DefaultFocusComponent.html">DefaultFocusComponent</ulink>
		interface and its
		<function>focusOnDefaultComponent()</function> method.
	</para>

	</sect2>

	<sect2><title>Services</title>
	
	<para>
		A new <filename>services.xml</filename> file can be provided in the
		plugin JAR file. The preferred way of adding virtual file systems, fold
		handlers and many other types of extensions is through this file. Its
		syntax is described in the documentation for the <ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/ServiceManager.html">ServiceManager</ulink>
		class.
	</para>

	</sect2>

	<sect2><title>Virtual File Systems</title>
	
	<para>
		Instead of calling <function>VFSManager.registerVFS()</function> in your
		plugin's <function>start()</function> method, add entries in the
		<filename>services.xml</filename> file that look like so:
	</para>

	<programlisting><![CDATA[<SERVICE CLASS="org.gjt.sp.jedit.io.VFS" NAME="ftp">
    new ftp.FtpVFS(false);
</SERVICE>]]></programlisting>

	<para>
		A new  <ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/io/VFS.DirectoryEntryCompare.html">VFS.DirectoryEntryCompare</ulink>
		class was added,
		for sorting lists of VFS directory entries.
	</para>

	<para>
		Fields named <varname>canRead</varname> and <varname>canWrite</varname>
		were added to the <ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/io/VFS.DirectoryEntry.html">VFS.DirectoryEntry</ulink>
		class.
	</para>

	<para>
		There is a new extended attribute API to go with the details view in the
		file system browser. Pass an array of extended attribute names to the
		<ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/io/VFS.html">VFS</ulink> constructor, then
		provide an implementation
		of the <function>getExtendedAttribute()</function> method in your
		subclass of <ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/io/VFS.DirectoryEntry.html">VFS.DirectoryEntry</ulink>.
	</para>

	<para>
		The following two methods in the <ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/io/VFSManager.html">VFSManager</ulink>
		class have been deprecated since they can no longer be implemented for
		file systems using the deferred loading API
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para><function>getVFSByName()</function> - use
		<function>getVFSForProtocol()</function>
		instead.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para><function>getFilesystems()</function> - use
		<function>getVFSs()</function>, which returns a string array,
		instead.</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	</sect2>

	<sect2><title>Fold Handlers</title>
	
	<para>
		Instead of calling <function>FoldHandler.registerFoldHandler()</function>
		in your
		plugin's <function>start()</function> method, add entries in the
		<filename>services.xml</filename> file that look like so:
	</para>

	<programlisting><![CDATA[<SERVICE CLASS="org.gjt.sp.jedit.buffer.FoldHandler" NAME="sidekick">
    new sidekick.SideKickFoldHandler()
</SERVICE>]]></programlisting>

	</sect2>

	<sect2><title>Other Services</title>

	<para>
		Currently, macro handlers and dynamic menus are not possible in the new
		plugin API. This will be addressed in 4.2pre2.
	</para>

	</sect2>

	</sect1>
	
	<sect1 id="common-api-changes"><title>Common API</title>
	
	<para>
		This section outlines API changes and enhancements
		which may affect both plugins and
		macros.
	</para>

	<sect2><title>Syntax Highlighting</title>
	
	<para>
		The <classname>org.gjt.sp.jedit.syntax</classname> package can now
		be used in other programs.
		All you need to provide is error handling and logic for locating
		the XML mode files. See the
		<ulink url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/syntax/package-summary.html">package
		documentation</ulink> for details.
	</para>

	</sect2>

	<sect2><title>Text Area and Folding</title>

	<para>The
		<ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/textarea/JEditTextArea.html">JEditTextArea</ulink>
		class has a new <function>addToLeftOfScrollBar()</function> method that
		adds a component to the left of the scroll bar. Previously plugins like
		JDiff had to resort to undocumented hacks to do this.
	</para>

	<para>
		The code that displays lines of text on screen has been overhauled for
		improved performance and correctness. As a result, two methods in
		<ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/textarea/JEditTextArea.html">JEditTextArea</ulink>
		that have been deprecated since jEdit 4.0 were removed:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para><function>xToOffset()</function></para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem><para><function>offsetToX()</function></para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
		As in jEdit 4.0 and 4.1, the <function>xyToOffset()</function> and
		<function>offseToXY()</function> methods replace these two.
	</para>

	<para>
		Also, the way folds are handled has changed. The
		<classname>FoldVisibilityManager</classname> class has been removed,
		and a number of methods in the <ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/textarea/JEditTextArea.html">JEditTextArea</ulink>
		class have been removed also:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para><function>virtualToPhysical()</function></para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem><para><function>physicalToVirtual()</function></para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem><para><function>getVirtualLineCount()</function></para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
		The replacement for the <classname>FoldVisibilityManager</classname>
		class is a class named <ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/io/DisplayManager.html">DisplayManager</ulink>,
		with a similar but not identical API.
	</para>

	<para>
		Previously, a <quote>virtual line number</quote> was a line number such
		that each physical line (delimited by <literal>\n</literal>) counted
		as 1 if it was visible, and 0 if it was not. They did not take into
		account lines that were split on screen as a result of soft wrap, and
		this made the soft wrap scrolling code rather complicated.
	</para>

	<para>
		In jEdit 4.2, virtual line numbers are no longer used internally; now,
		similar <quote>scroll line numbers</quote> are used. Scroll line numbers
		take both hidden lines and soft wrap into account. The
		<function>getFirstLine()</function> and
		<function>setFirstLine()</function> methods of the
		<ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/textarea/JEditTextArea.html">JEditTextArea</ulink>
		class now work with
		scroll line numbers.
	</para>

	<para>
		An internal API for converting between scroll line numbers and physical
		line numbers exists, but it is rather complicated and it will not be
		made public. Instead, if you want the text area to scroll to a given
		physical line number, use the new
		<function>setFirstPhysicalLine()</function> method in the
		<ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/textarea/JEditTextArea.html">JEditTextArea</ulink>
		class.
	</para>

	</sect2>

	<sect2 id="misc-api-changes"><title>Miscellaneous API Changes</title>
	
	<para>
		A new <function>View.goToBuffer()</function> method has been added.
		If the specified buffer is already
		visible in one of the view's edit panes, it sends focus to that edit
		pane. Otherwise, it calls <function>setBuffer()</function>
		on the current edit pane.
	</para>

	<para>
		The constructor of the <ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/io/EBMessage.html">EBMessage</ulink> class
		now takes
		an <classname>Object</classname>, as opposed to an
		<ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/io/EBComponent.html">EBComponent</ulink>.
		Plugins that provide custom message
		types will need to be recompiled.
	</para>
	
	<para>
		The following deprecated method was removed from the
		<ulink
		url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/io/GUIUtilities.html">GUIUtilities</ulink>
		class:
	</para>
	
	<para>
