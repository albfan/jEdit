TO DO

- rect select and soft wrap
- still problem with last phys line repainting
- vertical scrollbar w/ soft wrap wrong
- save to X:filename on Windows
- plugin manager needs overhauled error reporting
- motif l&f: shortcuts in menu items
- API guide: compareStrings(), showPopupMenu()
- MiscUtilities path name methods need to be documented
- plugin guide: mention fully qualified class names
- appendix in plugin guide on contributing plugins
- drag and up and down should not need setFirstLine() stupidity
- C+ENTER 1 ...
- idea for fixing buffer property issues: BufferProp class
- replace in selection with rectangular selections
- getCenterPoint()
- support multi-screen systems properly
- rollover toolbar buttons option
- fix page up/page down
- jdk 1.4: popups in wrong location
- updateChunksUpTo() called too many times
- plugin manager's progress bar: max value is download size
- removing a plugin should offer to remove the ones that depend on it too
- installing source for already installed plugins is not possible: 'hide
  already installed' checkbox in install plugins dialog box
- better formatting commands: - document in 'manual wrap' subsect of
  'word wrap'
  - format becomes 'wrap paragraph'
  - 'wrap line'
  - 'unwrap paragraph'
- don't repaint whole selection when resizing
- print should not use so much memory
- fs browser: scroll to visible after setting divider location
- if loadMode() throws error, save of a mode file fails?
- expand fold: try to expand even if already expanded
- keyboard navigation of current directory, recent dirs, etc broken
- JDK 1.4 focus bugs
- dwm: not always focused correctly
- stylesheet: keycap inside keycombo
- openFile(): can open two copies of the same buffer if a) remote b)
  canonPath != path; ditto for save as
- maybe fix GUIUtilities.java to store maximisation state
- idea to make things go faster: token marker splits on ' ', '\t'
  then lineToChunkList() has much less work to do, and could even be
  eliminated completely.
- text area painter:
  - use line metrics
  - use float co-ordinates
- C+d with selection: delete all selected lines
- last focused dockable cmd
- XModeHandler: better error reporting
- add index terms throughout user's guide!
- getFoldLevel(): should not call linesChanged() all the time
- v2p/p2v: implement from end backward scan
- loading and saving opt pane: 'choose' button for backup directory
- style setting for folding line indicator
- inefficencies: lots of File objects created for the sake of
  isAbsolute().
- help viewer: two tabs, contents and index. index browser
- file system browser:
  - commands->copy file list
  - much better autocomplete
  - pre-load open and search dialogs in background thread, and cache
    them
  - better permissions API
  - show wait cursor while directory is loading
  - directory chooser dialog box
- <file>?line= or ?marker=
- fold navigator to browse fold tree in explicit fold mode
- reintroduce -bshclient command line switch
- saving a read-only file: show a confirmation dialog box
- tool bar option pane: editing existing entries
- recording 'evaluate for selected lines'
- search and replace: scroll text area so selection is visible despite
  dialog position
- better auto indent
- HTML mode:
  - inside tags, delegate on*="..." to JavaScript mode,
    style="..." to CSS mode
  - better <script>/<style> handling using nested delegates
- save markers when a buffer is closed, adding/removing markers shouldn't
  set the dirty flag
- keymaps replace .shortcut properties
  - loaded from $HOME/.jedit/keymaps, and jedit.jar
  - one keymap can 'extend' another
  - keymaps are XML files with <bind>, <unbind> tags
  - jEdit, emacs, keymaps included, maybe others
  - instead of hard-coded modifier swapping on MacOS, have a MacOS keymap
- find next with $ or ^
- custom stylesheet: no xmlns
- eval-for-selected-lines doesn't work with rectangular selection
- how to handle S+0-9?
- if start is at the end of a line, .* always matches an empty string
- formatting problems in user's guide in table cells
- finish persistent splits code
- failed saves should not clear the dirty flag
- aborts not always fired
- globalColors setting:
  - tree controls, file system browser icons, tool bar icons look a bit
    ugly with different backgrounds
  - help viewer looks ugly
  - selected borders in list, tree, table wrong colors
- evalutate for selected lines: > 1 selection per line
- undo: redo doesn't clear dirty flag if necessary
- BrowserView.reloadDirectory(): hardcoded design decisions
- lower case all user's guide ids
- C+e , and . insert , and . in the buffer, ditto for [ and ]
