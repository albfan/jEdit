TO DO

Note that this is not a complete to do list. It mostly only lists bugs
and quirks that I need to fix eventually.

- mouse pressed ignored sometimes?
- poor performance sometimes
- control-drag on bracket
- overwrite cursor: behave like block
- popups still positioned poorly
- final optimization for OffsetManager: scan to zero or scan to end
  might be more economical
- do some profiling
- wheel mouse -- option: jEdit mods -vs- system-wide mods
- wheel mouse page scroll w/ soft wrap
- rect select and trailing whitespace
- user's guide:
  - vertical paste & rect select insertion
  - mention word splitting mechanism
  - updating-modes.xml - see above
  - examples of regexp matching
  - document new auto indent
  - part III
  - part IV
  - part V

- auto indent:
  if(foo)
    while(bar)
    {
      //
    }
  <--- cursor here
- respond to shortcuts on KeyTyped only, track KeyPressed/KeyReleased to
  know mod status
- some JLists do not auto-scroll on keystroke
- line 2112 -- isNarrowed() check of moveCaretPosition()
- format -- instead of \n\n, what if it has \n   \n?
- if A depends on B but A is loaded before B and B breaks, A ends up
  being loaded. Solution: load plugins in order of dependencies?
- A+# on OS X, need better modifier mapping on OS X
- change indentPrevLine to indentOneLine and indentSubsequentLines
- scrolling horizontally when dragging into virtual space: a bit quirky
- eval-for-selected-lines doesn't work with rectangular selection
- focus problem with hypersearch in floating window
- plugin manager: install plugins, no restart, install another: deps bad
- plugin deps need JAR name, not plugin name
- first focus: show all files that were modified on disk, in a list
- support multi-screen systems properly
  - windows need to be created on the same screen as their parent if
    possible.
  - setLocationRelativeTo(): ok
  - loadGeometry(): bad
  - dockable windows
  - getCenterPoint()
  - popup menus
- maximisation state bug: open window, resize to size X. close window,
  open window again, resize to size Y. maximise. close window, open
  window again, it has size X not size Y.
- C+ENTER 1 ...
- fs browser: scroll to visible after setting divider location
- expand fold: try to expand even if already expanded
- openFile(): can open two copies of the same buffer if a) remote b)
  canonPath != path
- recording 'evaluate for selected lines'
- how to handle S+0-9?
- aborts not always fired
- globalColors setting:
  - help viewer looks ugly
  - selected borders in list, tree, table wrong colors
- evalutate for selected lines: > 1 selection per line
- undo: redo doesn't clear dirty flag if necessary
- C+e , and . insert , and . in the buffer, ditto for [ and ]
- motif l&f: shortcuts in menu items
- fix pg up/down with soft wrap

+ verify:

- searching in a buffer w/ narrowed fold
- sometimes trying to extend a selection creates one all the way to the
  end of the buffer
- narrow to one line: select all: blows up
- dwm: not always focused correctly
- JDK 1.4 focus bugs
- if loadMode() throws error, save of a mode file fails?

  -- trying to show a non-existent dockable

+ cleanups:

- clean up VFSManager.errorOccurred() -vs- BufferIORequest.ERROR_OCCURRED
- BrowserView.reloadDirectory(): hardcoded design decisions
- finish persistent splits code
- custom stylesheet: no xmlns
- NO_WORD_BREAK and NO_LINE_BREAK: need to think about this, is it worth
  keeping INVALID? report errors in some other manner?
- clean up the way macro hierarchy is stored
- dialog parenting for fsb colors pane, vfs browser dialog
- move text utility methods to TextUtilities
- minor quicknotepad changes -- update docs
- requestDefaultFocus() is bad

+ features:

- close current area w/ dockables that don't implement
  requestDefaultFocus()
- add dockable window state change msg
- range-comment & rect select
- support rect start in virtual space too

+ performance:

- positions should be gapped too
- try typing foo), put cursor after foo, type some more -- slowdown
- eliminate redundant scans and events when loading buffer
- make vfs listing faster
- don't repaint whole selection when resizing
- background tokens are slow
- backward virtual line scan
- do not call foldVisibilityManager.getLastVisibleLine() on every change
  w/ soft wrap. kills performance if also narrowed.
- if caret is at the end of a buffer when doing a replace all, a lot of
  repaint() and getLineOfOffset() calls are made, however this doesn't
  seem to affect performance that much.
