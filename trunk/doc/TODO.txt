TO DO

Note that this is not a complete to do list. It mostly only lists bugs
and quirks that I need to fix eventually.

- complete word not wide enough
- new files in perspective -- something's broken
- test keyboard completion with expanded/collapsed tree
- test keyboard completion with high latency VFS
- file system browser: 2 clicks don't hide menus in jdk 1.5
- file system browser: tigten gap on left of tool bar
- option to disable context menu
- plugin mgr inspection of not-loaded plugins
- history text field tweak
- optional dependencies
- tall caret and tab
- need timeouts for plugin manager list download.
- in search bar, C+y a doesn't work
- printing: check default printer setting
- vfs updates still broken
- "downloading plugin list" label in plugin manager
- column reference counting broken
- new file: horiz scroll wrong
- enter after a fold broken *AGAIN*
- fsb default size

+ docs:

- add note that regexp matching does not cross newlines in token marker
- add note to documentation about exponential-time regexps
- news: deep indent, action bar, new cli options
- action bar
- document deep indent
- quicknotepad help needs to be generated
- note about dependencies
- help:
  - titles in search are fucked
- sidebars: need a border or some sort
- user's guide:
  - part III
    - describe alternative ways to obtain buffers, edit panes, text areas,
      in a sidebar about changing them
- examples of EOL_SPAN_REGEXP matching in docs
- plugin tutorial:
  - plugin build environment docs
  - auto-created actions
  - link to jEdit devel page
  - quicknotepad class -- links to API docs
  - functions - links to API docs
  - quicknotepad docs
- plugin tips and techniques:
  - common. properties, using properties for UI strings
  - cutting down on startup time
  - canned dialog boxes in GUIUtilities
  - tools.jar
  - string comparison in MiscUtilities
  - writing a macro handler
  - writing a fold handler
  - OperatingSystem class
  - option groups
  - listening for buffer changes
  - canned controls:
    animated icon, color well button, enhanced dialog,
    font selector, history text field, 
    jcheckboxlist, rolloverbutton,
    variablegridlayout
  - displaying a help viewer
  - canned icons
  - vfs implementation
  - running stuff in i/o threads
  - multi-threaded i/o
  - jeditresource: protocol
  - getting line syntax info, textutilities.getTokenAtOffset()
  - text area extensions
  - text area caret & scroll listeners
  - status bar messages & readNextChar()
- vfs javadoc: invokeAndWait() example for createVFSSession()

+ obscure:

- no need to wait for requests after newFile()
- class loading problems
- motif l&f: shortcuts in menu items
- some JLists do not auto-scroll on keystroke
- C+b -- click -- keys don't work
- how to handle S+0-9?
- clean up VFSManager.errorOccurred() -vs- BufferIORequest.ERROR_OCCURRED
- auto indent: don't de-indent on enter if no leading indent at all?
- remove-marker, select-next/prev-marker/bracket
- gzip & unicode, or gzip & <?xml encoding...
- new macro handler api
- invoking action bar command twice
- backup time distance setting
- if A depends on B but A is loaded before B and B breaks, A ends up
  being loaded. Solution: load plugins in order of dependencies?
- expand fold: try to expand even if already expanded
- format -- instead of \n\n, what if it has \n   \n?
- C+ENTER 3 C+2
- tall caret and tab
- don't show 'new directory' in favorites:
- auto indent:
  if(foo)
    while(bar)
    {
      //
    }
  <--- cursor here

+ performance:

- closing lots of files is slow -- esp. with close all dialog box!
- menu drag: slow
- bracket matching: no delay for current line match??
- final optimization for OffsetManager: scan to zero or scan to end
- do buffer load AWT half immediately after work thread half
- replace all in a directory could be faster
- buffer.setMode() slow
- eliminate redundant scans and events when loading buffer
- make vfs listing faster
- don't repaint whole selection when resizing
- could make non-soft wrap chunk merge even faster!
- syntax SPAN::END substitution: String --> char[] --> String
- is getScreenLineOfOffset() called often?
- if caret is at the end of a buffer when doing a replace all, a lot of
  repaint() and getLineOfOffset() calls are made
- optimize for no folding & no soft wrap case:
  - reset() and changed() don't need to scan
  - scroll/physUp/Down() simpler
- inserting lines repaints whole text area
- see if getLineOfOffset() can be optimized
- optimize 1 long line case
- two repaints in line insert
- redundant calls to recalculateLastPhysicalLines()/updateScrollBars()
- redundant updateChunksUpTo() calls
