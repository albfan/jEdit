TO DO

+ 4.0.1:

- need to investigate:
  - scroll to caret _still_ jumps around?
  - mouse clicks not working?
- printer output spacing problem
- support multi-screen systems properly
  - windows need to be created on the same screen as their parent if
    possible.
  - setLocationRelativeTo(): ok
  - loadGeometry(): bad
  - dockable windows
  - getCenterPoint()

+ in 4.1:

- escape in panel window container -> focus back to text area?
- fix GUIUtilities.java to store maximisation state
- drag and up and down should not need setFirstLine() stupidity
- C+ENTER 1 ...
- idea for fixing buffer property issues: BufferProp class
- fix page up/page down
- don't repaint whole selection when resizing
- print should not use so much memory
- fs browser: scroll to visible after setting divider location
- if loadMode() throws error, save of a mode file fails?
- expand fold: try to expand even if already expanded
- keyboard navigation of current directory, recent dirs, etc broken
- JDK 1.4 focus bugs
- dwm: not always focused correctly
- openFile(): can open two copies of the same buffer if a) remote b)
  canonPath != path
- getFoldLevel(): should not call linesChanged() all the time
- v2p/p2v: implement from end backward scan
- recording 'evaluate for selected lines'
- custom stylesheet: no xmlns
- eval-for-selected-lines doesn't work with rectangular selection
- how to handle S+0-9?
- finish persistent splits code
- aborts not always fired
- globalColors setting:
  - tree controls, file system browser icons, tool bar icons look a bit
    ugly with different backgrounds
  - help viewer looks ugly
  - selected borders in list, tree, table wrong colors
- evalutate for selected lines: > 1 selection per line
- undo: redo doesn't clear dirty flag if necessary
- BrowserView.reloadDirectory(): hardcoded design decisions
- C+e , and . insert , and . in the buffer, ditto for [ and ]
- triple-click drag down
- motif l&f: shortcuts in menu items
- clean up VFSManager.errorOccurred() -vs- BufferIORequest.ERROR_OCCURRED
