    <title>Bundling Additional Class Libraries</title>

    <para>Recall that any class whose name ends with
    <classname>Plugin.class</classname> is called a plugin core class. JAR
    files with no plugin core classes are also loaded by jEdit; the classes
    they contain are made available to other plugins. Many plugins that rely
    on third-party class libraries ship them as separate JAR files. The
    libraries will be available inside the jEdit environment but are not part
    of a general classpath or library collection when running other Java
    applications.</para>

    <para>A plugin that bundles extra JAR files must list them in the
    <filename>plugin.<replaceable>class name</replaceable>.jars</filename>
    property. See the documentation for the <ulink
    url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/EditPlugin.html">
    <classname>EditPlugin</classname></ulink> class for details.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="plugin-tips-non-java-libraries">
    <title>Bundling Additional Non-Java Libraries</title>

    <para>If your plugin bundles non-Java files, like native libraries, you
    need to list them in the <filename>plugin.<replaceable>class
    name</replaceable>.files</filename> property. If you don't do so, they
    don't get deleted if the plugin is uninstalled. See the documentation for
    the <ulink url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/EditPlugin.html">
    <classname>EditPlugin</classname></ulink> class for details.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="plugin-tips-plugin-data">
    <title>Storing plugin data</title>

    <para>If your plugin needs to create files and store data in the
    filesystem, you should use the <methodname>getPluginHome()</methodname>
    API of the <classname>EditPlugin</classname> class. To signal that you use
    the plugin home API you have to set the
    <filename>plugin.<replaceable>class
    name</replaceable>.usePluginHome</filename> property to
    <constant>true</constant>. Even if your plugin doesn't create any files,
    you should set the property to <constant>true</constant>, so that e. g.
    the plugin manager knows that there is actually no data in favor of not
    knowing if there is any data and thus displaying that it doesn't know the
    data size. See the documentation for the <ulink
    url="../api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/EditPlugin.html"><classname>EditPlugin</classname></ulink>
    class for details.</para>
