These are the test cases for indentation related issues.

Electric keys testing:
01.cpp - std::
02.py - if if else
03.java - if broken in 2 lines and "? :" expression
04.java - : inside a string literal or bracketing a single statement
05.sh - a function beginning with a keyword in basic-like languages

Typical cases where automatic indentation should work on current line:
java, c:
  {} brackets, a label ending with ":", 
python:
  "else:" should be indented left
bash:
  "fi" should go left
