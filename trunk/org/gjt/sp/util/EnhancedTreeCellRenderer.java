/**
 * An enhancement of the {@link DefaultTreeCellRenderer} to be used as superclass for custom
 * tree cell renderers. Using {@code DefaultTreeCellRenderer} as superclass for a custom tree
 * cell renderer without further measures is not stable in regards to on-the-fly Look and Feel
 * changes, at least not with Java 6. For Java 7 it should be tested again.
 * <p>
 * With Java 6 the {@code DefaultTreeCellRenderer} initializes some values according to the
 * Look and Feel in its constructor. If the {@code DefaultTreeCellRenderer} is created by the
 * {@link JTree} code, it is recreated on a Look and Feel change. This way all works fine. But
 * if a tree cell renderer is set explicitly on the {@code JTree}, no matter whether
 * {@code DefaultTreeCellRenderer}, a subclass of it or a complete own implementation, the
 * set instance is used beyond Look and Feel boundaries and this causes two problems.
 * <ol>
 *     <li>
 *         The values that were initialized in the constructor of {@code DefaultTreeCellRenderer}
 *         are not reset according to the new Look and Feel. Some values are partly set by the
 *         {@code JTree} code, but this is not complete and reliable and thus the renderer paints
 *         the tree cells wrongly.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         The Look and Feel change is first applied to the {@code JTree}, then the sizes of
 *         the tree cells which are saved in a cache are recalculated. Only <b>after</b> that,
 *         the children of the {@code JTree} get the new Look and Feel applied, amongst them
 *         also the tree cell renderer.<br>
 *         So even if a custom tree cell renderer is aware of on-the-fly Look and Feel changes
 *         by reinitializing values from the Look and Feel if it changes, those cached sizes
 *         are still calculated for the old Look and Feel. The only way to work around this is
 *         to cause the cached sizes to be recalculated. This can be done by changing any
 *         significant property of the {@code JTree} which influences size calculations.
 *     </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * To work around the described problems this enhanced tree cell renderer listens for Look
 * and Feel changes on the {@code JTree} where this renderer is used, requests a subclass
 * to create a new instance of the renderer and sets it on the {@code JTree}. By doing so
 * the {@code DefaultTreeCellRenderer} reinitializes to the new Look and Feel in its
 * constructor and the {@code JTree} recalculates the cached size values because a different
 * object is set as tree cell renderer.
