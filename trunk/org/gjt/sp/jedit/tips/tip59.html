jEdit's text editing commands become very powerful when used together.
For example, here is one way, when programming in Java,
to find all uses of an instance variable that are outside the current
method:

<ul>
<li><b>Control</b>-click on the method's opening bracket to select the entire method.
<li>Invoke <b>Edit</b>&gt;<b>Invert Selection</b> (<b>C+e i</b>).
<li>Invoke <b>Search</b>&gt;<b>Find</b> (<b>C+f</b>).
<li>Type in the variable name and press <b>Enter</b>.
<li>Because text is selected, the <b>HyperSearch</b> and
<b>Search in Selection</b> settings will be chosen by default.
<li>The <b>HyperSearch Results</b> window will list all uses of
that variable outside the selected method.
</ul>
