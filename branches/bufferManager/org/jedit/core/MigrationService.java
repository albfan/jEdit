/** A Migration service.
 * <br>
 * The goal of migration is usually to replace old properties or data files
 * with a new set, located elsewhere. The fact is that depending on where
 * the data needs to be updated, the migration may need to be done at
*  different places during jEdit's startup. <br>
 * There is no specific time that all migration services are called currently.
 * The service and interface exists primarily so you don't need to add a compilation
 * dependency of the org.gjt.sp.jEdit class to your MigrationService class. <br>
 * <br>
 * Concrete instances need to guarantee that the migration itself is only done
 * once.
 * @see org.jedit.migration.OneTimeMigrationService
