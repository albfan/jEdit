Packaging jEdit for release
==================================================

This document contains instructions on how to create and release jEdit for distribution, with all of the installers.

The analogous document for releasing plugins is in the jedit SVN repository under the name "pjo/doc/pjo.txt".

Release Workflow
================
Before you read this document, be sure to read first the README.SRC.txt, in the root source directory. It contains instructions on how to get and set up Apache Ant, what the targets mean, and what you need to build each kind of package.

Workflow
--------

1. Execute the BeanShell snippet at the end of this file ("Utilities -> BeanShell -> Evaluate Selection"). This will replace the version tags in this document by actual version numbers for easy copy & paste.

2. Review https://svn.code.sf.net/p/jedit/svn/jEdit/branches/5.2.x/doc/CHANGES.txt for formatting errors (like missing newline characters, wrong indentation or empty blocks), fix them and check them in.

3. Tag the sourcecode for release in the SVN repository by doing
        svn copy https://svn.code.sf.net/p/jedit/svn/jEdit/branches/5.2.x https://svn.code.sf.net/p/jedit/svn/jEdit/tags/jedit-5-2-0 -m "Tagging 5.2.0 for release."
   with the correct version in the second URL and in the commit message

4. To be sure to work with the exact tagged source, check out the newly tagged source in a new directory by doing
        svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/jedit/svn/jEdit/tags/jedit-5-2-0
   no matter where. You will find the source in a subfolder jedit-5-2-0 where you executed the command

5. Copy build.properties from your jEdit source directory to the newly created jedit-5-2-0 source directory if needed. If you don't have it, then create it if needed. You find a template called build.properties.sample in the root directory.
   To give an example, in build.properties I customized the following properties:
    - wine.executable=wine
    - winepath.executable=winepath
    - innosetup.compiler.executable=/home/vampire/.wine/drive_c/Programme/Inno Setup 5/ISCC.exe
    - innosetup.via.wine=true
    - gpg.secring=/home/vampire/.gnupg/secring.gpg
   You may not need to customize the same properties than me, e. g. if you are on Windows you don't need to set the three wine properties.
   For further information about what you need to build the source, please read README.SRC.txt in the sources root directory.

6.1. Build the distribution files by doing
          ant dist
     in the jedit-5-2-0 directory
     In the newly created directory jedit-5-2-0/dist you find 13 files:
      - jedit5.2.0manual-a4.pdf
      - jedit5.2.0manual-letter.pdf
      - jedit5.2.0source.tar.bz2
      - jedit5.2.0install.jar
      - jedit-5.2.0-noarch-1sao.tgz
      - jedit_5.2.0_all.deb
      - jedit5.2.0install.exe or jedit5.2.0-dist-win-finish.tar.bz2
      - jedit5.2.0install.dmg or jedit5.2.0-dist-mac-finish.tar.bz2
      - Packages
      - Packages.gz
      - Packages.bz2
      - Release
      - Release.gpg

6.2. If you have jedit5.2.0-dist-win-finish.tar.bz2 in your jedit-5-2-0/dist folder you probably don't run a Windows box and don't have wine installed and set up, so please hand over this file to someone (e. g. <Björn "Vampire" Kautler> Vampire@jEdit.org) who does and ask him to unpack the file and run
          ant dist-win-finish
     and to hand over the resulting file jedit5.2.0install.exe to you. The requirements for this are described in README.SRC.txt

6.3. If you have jedit5.2.0-dist-mac-finish.tar.bz2 in your jedit-5-2-0/dist folder you probably don't run a Mac OS X box, so please hand over this file to someone (e. g. Björn "Vampire" Kautler <Vampire@jEdit.org>) who does and ask him to unpack the file and run
          ant dist-mac-finish
     and to hand over the resulting file jedit5.2.0install.dmg to you. The requirements for this are described in README.SRC.txt

6.4. After you received the final distribution files jedit5.2.0install.exe and jedit5.2.0install.dmg you can delete jedit5.2.0-dist-win-finish.tar.bz2 and jedit5.2.0-dist-mac-finish.tar.bz2

6.5. If you don't have Release.gpg, you didn't have setup a GPG secring. Either create a GPG secring, run
          ant dist-sign-deb-Release
     , upload the public key to a public keyserver and make sure your key is mentioned on http://jedit.org/index.php?page=download&platform=unix#option_two so the users know the key is valid for signing jEdit releases. Alternatively send Release to someone whose key is already mentioned on the download page (e. g. Björn "Vampire" Kautler <Vampire@jEdit.org>) and ask him to put Release in the dist folder, to run
          ant dist-sign-deb-Release
     and to hand over the resulting file Release.gpg to you. The second way is preferable if you only create a release once or from time to time as a new key means the user will get confused and has to react for verifying and installing the new key.
